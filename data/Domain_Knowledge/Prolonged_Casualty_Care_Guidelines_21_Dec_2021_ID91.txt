JOINT TRAUMA SYSTEM CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE (JTS CPG) 
Prolonged Casualty Care Guidelines (CPG ID:91) 
The Prolonged Casualty Care (PCC) guidelines are a consolidated list 
of casualty-centric knowledge, skills, and best practices intended to serve 
as the DoD baseline clinical practice guidance to guide casualty management 
over a prolonged amount of time in austere, remote, or expeditionary settings, 
and/or during long-distance movements.

PROLONGED CASUALTY CARE BACKGROUND 
Prolonged Casualty Care (PCC): The need to provide patient care for extended periods of time when 
evacuation or mission requirements surpass available capabilities and/or capacity to provide that care. 
The PCC guidelines are a consolidated list of casualty-centric knowledge, skills, abilities, and best 
practices intended to serve as the DoD baseline clinical practice guidance (CPG) to direct casualty 
management over a prolonged period of time in austere, remote, or expeditionary settings, and/or 
during long-distance movements. These PCC guidelines build upon the DoD standard of care for nonmedical and medical first responders as established by the Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care 
(CoTCCC), outlined in the Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines,1 and in accordance with 
(IAW) DoDI 1322. 24. 
The guidelines were developed by the PCC Work Group (PCC WG). The PCC WG is chartered under the 
Defense Committee on Trauma (DCoT) to provide subject matter expertise supporting the Joint Trauma 
System (JTS) mission to improve trauma readiness and outcomes through evidence-driven performance 
improvement. The PCC WG is responsible for reviewing, assessing, and providing solutions for PCCrelated shortfalls and requirements as outlined in DoD Instruction (DoDI) 1322. 24, Medical Readiness 
Training, 16 Mar 2018, under the authority of the JTS as the DoD Center of Excellence pursuant to DoDI 
6040. 47, JTS, 05 Aug 2018. 
Operational and medical planning should seek to avoid categorizing PCC as a primary medical support 
capability or control factor during deliberate risk assessment; however, an effective medical plan always 
includes PCC as a contingency. Ideally, forward surgical and critical care should be provided as close to 
casualties as possible to optimize survivability. 2 DoD units must be prepared for medical capacity to be 
overwhelmed, or for medical evacuation to be delayed or compromised. When contingencies arise, 
commanders’ casualty response plans during PCC situations are likely to be complex and challenging. 
Therefore, PCC planning, training, equipping, and sustainment strategies must be completed prior to a 
PCC event. The following evidence-driven PCC guidelines are 
designed to establish a systematic framework to synchronize 
critical medical decisions points into an executable PCC strategy, 
regardless of the nature of injury or illness, to effectively manage a 
complex patient and to advise commanders of associated risks. 
The guidelines build upon the accepted TCCC categories framed in 
the novel MARC2H3-PAWS-L treatment algorithm, (Massive 
Hemorrhage/MASCAL, Airway, Respirations, Circulation, 
Communications, Hypo/Hyperthermia and Head Injuries, Pain 
Control, Antibiotics, Wounds (including Nursing and Burns), 
Splinting, Logistics). 
The PCC guidelines prepare the Service Member for “what to 
consider next” after all TCCC interventions have been effectively 
performed and should only be trained after having mastering the 
principles and techniques of TCCC. 
The guidelines are a consolidated list of casualty-centric 
knowledge, skills, abilities, and best practices are the proposed 
standard of care for developing and sustaining DoD programs

required to enhance confidence, interoperability, and common trust among all PCC-adept personnel 
across the Joint force. 
The JTS CPGs are foundational to the PCC guidelines and will be referenced throughout this document in 
an effort to keep these guidelines concise. General information on the Joint Trauma System is available 
on the JTS website (https://jts.amedd.army.mil) and links to all of the CPGs are also available by using 
the following link: https://jts.amedd.army.mil/index.cfm/PI_CPGs/cpgs. 
The TCCC guidelines are included in these guidelines as an attachment because they are foundational 
AND prerequisite to effective PCC. Remember, the primary goal in PCC is to get out of PCC!!! 
PCC PRINCIPLES 
The principles and strategies of providing effective prolonged casualty care are meant to help organize 
the overwhelming amount of critical information into a clear clinical picture and proactive plan 
regardless of the nature of injury or illness. The following steps can be implemented in any austere 
environment from dispersed small team operations in permissive environments to large scale combat 
operations to make the care of a critically ill patient more efficient for the medic and their team. These 
mimic the systems and processes in typical intensive care units without relying on technology while 
leaving the ability to add technological adjuncts as they become available. The following checklist is 
meant to emphasize some of the most important principles in efficient care of the critically ill patient.

Steps of PCC Principles 
 
Prolonged Casualty Care Guidelines 
CPG ID: 91 
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 
7 
1. Perform initial lifesaving care using TCCC guidelines and continue resuscitation. 
The foundation of good PCC is mastery of TCCC and a strong foundation in clinical medicine. 
2. Delineate roles and responsibilities, including naming a team leader. 
A leader should be appointed who will manage the larger clinical picture while assistants focus 
on attention intensive tasks. 
3. Perform comprehensive physical exam and detailed history with problem list and care plan. 
After initial care and stabilization of a trauma or medical patient, a detailed physical exam and 
history should be performed for the purpose of completing a comprehensive problem list and 
corresponding care plan. 
4. Record and trend vital signs. 
Vital signs trending should be done with the earliest set of vital signs taken and continued at 
regular intervals so that the baseline values can be compared to present reality on a dedicated 
trending chart. 
5. Perform a teleconsultation. 
As soon as is feasible, the medic should prepare a teleconsultation by either filling out a 
preformatted script or by writing down their concerns along with the latest patient information. 
6. Create a nursing care plan. 
Nursing care and environmental considerations should be addressed early to limit any providerinduced iatrogenic injury. 
7. Implement team wake, rest, chow plan. 
The medic and each of their first responders should make all efforts to take care of each other 
by insisting on short breaks for rest, food, and mental decompression. 
8. Anticipate resupply and electrical issues 
9. Perform periodic mini rounds assessments. 
Stepping back from the immediate care of the patient periodically and re-engaging with a mini 
patient round and review of systems can allow the medic to recognize changes in the condition 
of the patient and reprioritize interventions. 
 Is the patient stable or unstable? 
 Is the patient sick or not sick? 
 Is the patient getting better or getting worse? 
 How is this assessment different from the last assessment? 
10. Obtain and interpret lab studies. 
When available, labs may be used to augment these trends and physical exam findings to 
confirm or rule out probable diagnoses. 
11. Perform necessary surgical procedures. 
The decision to perform invasive and surgical interventions should consider both risks and 
benefit to the patient’s overall outcome and not merely the immediate goal. 
12. Prepare for transportation or evacuation care. 
If the medic is caring for the patient over a long tactical move or strategic evacuation, they 
should be prepared with ample drugs, fluids, supplies and be ready for all contingencies in flight. 
Prolonged Casualty Care Guidelines 
CPG ID: 91 
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment

13. Prepare documentation for patient handover. 
The preparation for transportation and evacuation care should begin immediately upon 
assuming care for the patient and should include hasty and detailed evacuation requests up 
both the medical and operational channels with the goal of getting the patient to the proper 
role of care as soon as possible. 
Guideline User Notes 
PCC operational context uses the following paradigm for phases of care for different periods of time one 
is in a PCC scenario: 
Table 1. Roles of Care 
Role 
Definition 
Time Period 
1a 
Carried/Point of Need/Ruck 
<1 Hour 
1b 
Mission-specific transportation platform/Truck 
1-4 Hours 
1c 
Mission support site/House 
>4 Hours 
1d 
Evacuation platform/Plane (as planned or available) 
No Timeframe 
 
Where appropriate, a minimum-better-best format is included for situations in which the operational 
reality precludes optimal care for a given scenario: 
 Minimum: This is the minimum level of care which should be delivered for a specified level of 
capability 
 Better: When available or practical, this includes treatment strategies or adjuncts that improve 
outcomes while still not considered the standard of care. 
 Best: This is the optimal medical for a given scenario based on the level of medical expertise of 
the provider 
Expectations of prehospital care, based on TCCC's role-based standard of care, are included within each 
section: 
 Tier 1: This is the basic medical knowledge for all service-members. 
 Tier 2: Those who have been through approved CLS training are expected to be able to meet the 
standards at this level of care. 
 Tier 3 (Combat Medics/Corpsmen [CMC]): Those who are trained medics/corpsmen are 
expected to meet the medical standards for this tier. 
 Tier 4 (Combat Paramedic/Provider [CPP]): This is the highest level of prehospital capability and 
will have a significantly expanded scope of practice.

MASCAL/TRIAGE - PCC 
Background 
The foundation of effective PCC is accurate triage for both treatment in the PCC setting and for 
transportation to a higher level of care, as well as effective resource management across the entire 
trauma system. Resource management includes the appropriate utilization of medical and non-medical 
personnel, equipment and supplies, communications, and evacuation platforms. Like most Mass 
Casualty incidents (MASCAL), the purpose of triage in a PCC setting is to swiftly identify casualty needs 
for optimal resource allocation in order to improve patient outcomes. However, PCC presents unique 
and dynamic triage challenges while managing casualties over a prolonged period with a low likelihood 
of receiving additional medical supplies or personnel with enhanced medical capabilities apart from 
pre-established networks. MASCAL in a PCC environment will necessitate more conservative resource 
allocation than traditional MASCAL in mature theaters or fixed medical facilities where damage control 
surgery, intensive care, and medical logistical support are more readily available, and resupply is more 
likely. PCC dictates the need for implementing various triage and resource management techniques to 
ensure the greatest good for all. The objectives and basic strategies are the same for all MASCAL; 
however, tactics will vary depending on the available resources and situations. 
MASCAL Decision Points 
1. Determine if a PCC MASCAL is occurring – do the requirements for care exceed capabilities? 
 What is the threat? Has it been neutralized or contained? If not, security takes priority. 
 What is the total casualty estimate? 
 Are there resource limitations that will affect survival? 
 Can medical personnel arrive at the casualty location, or can the casualty move to them? 
 Is evacuation possible? 
 Communicate the situation to all available personnel conducting or enabling PCC. 
 Assess requirements for which class of triage you are facing (see Appendix C) and scale 
medical action to maximize lethality then survivability. 
 Remain agile and be ready to move based on the mission. 
2. Determine if conditions require significant changes in the commonly understood and accepted 
standards of care (Crisis Standards of Care)3 or if personnel who are not ordinarily qualified for a 
particular medical skill will need to deliver care. MASCAL in PCC requires both medical and 
non-medical responders initially save lives and preserve survivable casualties. Both groups will 
need skills traditionally outside existing paradigms, such as non-medical personnel taking and 
record vital signs or Tier 3 TCCC medical personnel maintaining vent settings on a stable patient. 
The MASCAL standard of care will be driven by the volume of casualties, resources, and risk or 
mortality/morbidity due to degree of injury/illness; as such, remain agile throughout the 
MASCAL and trend in both directions based upon resources available. 
3. MASCAL management is often intuitive and reactive (due to lack of full mission training 
opportunities) and should rely on familiar terminology and principles. Treatment and casualty 
movement should be rehearsed to create automatic responses. 
Prolonged Casualty Care Guidelines 
CPG ID: 91 
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 
10 
4. The tactical and strategic operational context will underpin every facet of MASCAL in a PCC 
environment, operational commanders MUST be involved in every stage of MASCAL response 
(The mere fact that a medical professional or team of medical professionals is forced to hold a 
casualty longer than doctrinal planning timelines means there is a failure in the 
operational/logistical evacuation chain. Battle lines, ground-to-air threat, etc. levels may have 
shifted.) 
5. Logistical resupply may need to include non-standard means and involve personnel and 
departments not typically associated with Class VIII in other situations (i.e. aerial resupply, 
speedballs, caches, local national market procurement). 
6. The most experienced person should establish MASCAL roles and responsibilities, as 
appropriate. 
Key Considerations in MASCAL 
 Usually, simpler is better. 
 Focus on those that will preserve scarce resources, such as blood. 
 Triage is a continuous process and should be repeated as often as is clinically and operationally 
practical. 
 Avoid high resource and low yield interventions. 
 Emergency airway interventions should prioritize REVERSIBLE pathology in salvageable patients. 
 Decisions will depend on available resources and skillsets (i.e. penetrating traumatic brain injury 
[TBI] triaged differently if no neurosurgery is available in a timely manner or at all in theater). 
 Conserve, ration, and redistribute additional scarce resources (i.e. blood, drug).

MASSIVE HEMORRHAGE - PCC 
Background 
Early recognition and intervention for life-threatening hemorrhage are essential for survival. The 
immediate priorities are to control life-threatening hemorrhage and maintain vital organ perfusion with 
rapid blood transfusion. 4 
Pre-deployment, Mission Planning, and Training Considerations 
1. Conduct unit level blood donor testing (for blood typing, transfusion transmitted diseases and 
Low Titer blood type O titers) and develop operational roster. 
2. Define Cold Chain Stored Whole Blood (CSWB) distribution quantities in area of responsibility. 
3. Manage and equip prehospital blood storage program if unit policies and procedures allow for 
prehospital blood storage.

AIRWAY MANAGEMENT - PCC 
Background 
Airway compromise is the second leading cause of potentially survivable death on the battlefield after 
hemorrhage. 6 Complete airway occlusion can cause death from suffocation within minutes. Austere 
environments present significant challenges with airway management. Limited provider experience and 
skill, equipment, resources, and medications shape the best management techniques. Considerations 
include: limited availability of supplemental oxygen; medications for induction/rapid sequence 
intubation, paralysis, and post-intubation management; and limitations in available equipment. Another 
reality is limitations in sustainment training options, especially for advanced airway techniques. Due to 
these challenges, some common recommendations that may be considered “rescue” techniques in 
standard hospital airway management may be recommended earlier or in a non-standard fashion to 
establish and control an airway in a PCC environment. Patients who require advanced airway placement 
tend to undergo more interventions, be more critically injured, and ultimately have a higher proportion 
of deaths. The ability to rapidly and consistently manage an airway when indicated, or spend time on 
other resuscitative needs when airway management is not indicated, may contribute to improved 
outcomes. 7,8

RESPIRATION AND VENTILATION - PCC 
Background 
Respiration is the process of gas exchange at the cellular level. Oxygen is conducted into the lung and 
taken up by the blood via hemoglobin to be transported throughout the body. In the peripheral tissues, 
carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen, which is transported by the blood to the lungs, where it is 
exhaled. This process is essential to cellular and organism survival. Dysfunction of this process is a 
feature of multiple-injury patterns that can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.

 If definitive airway is required, consider cricothyrotomy tube as less sedation and pain 
management is required to facilitate a patent and secure method for respirations. 
 
 
 
 
 Ensure interventions noted above are completed by TCCC ASM, CLS, and CMC personnel. 
 Conduct inventory of all resources. 
 Document all pertinent information on PCC Flowsheet (attached).

Additional Considerations 
 When in a PCC environment, simple monitoring technologies are able to be used by most 
providers in each of the provider categories to ensure adequate gas exchange and oxygen 
delivery. Peripheral oxygen saturation can be measured using a pulse oximeter which provides a 
measurement of hemoglobin saturation and, by inference, the effectiveness of measures to 
oxygenate a patient. Ventilation can be monitored with end-tidal carbon dioxide. The use of 
these tools together in a PCC environment provides estimates of oxygen transport to the cells, 
tissue metabolism, and adequacy of ventilation. 
 Providers in the PCC environment can adopt, implement, monitor, and sustain respiration using 
concepts of manipulating minute ventilation (respiratory rate multiplied by tidal volume). Put 
simply, it is the number of times a patient is breathing each minute multiplied by the amount of 
air breathed in with each breath. 
 Support of adequate minute ventilation can be performed in an escalating algorithm with rescue 
breathing, bag valve mask assisted ventilation, and mechanical ventilation. Each of these 
methods may require escalation of airway management skills and respiratory skills. 
Manipulation of any of the variables of minute ventilation will alter gas exchange. Therefore, 
medical providers in the PCC environment at all levels will need to be competent with the 
monitoring devices appropriate to their level of training. At a minimum, all providers with 
specific medical training should be competent to use and interpret the previous paragraph's 
monitoring devices. 
 The causes of respiratory failure can overlap and become confusing. When in doubt and 
whenever possible, initiate a Telemedicine Consultation for further guidance and input.

CIRCULATION AND RESUSCITATION - PCC 
Background 
PCC presents a unique challenge for implementing damage control resuscitation (DCR) as defined by the 
JTS guideline. PCC goes beyond DCR and should bridge the gap between the prevention of death, the 
preservation of life, and definitive care. The goals are a return to a normal level of consciousness (LOC), 
increase and stabilization of systolic blood pressure at 100 - 110 mm Hg when appropriate, and 
stabilization of vital signs – Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, etc.

COMMUNICATION AND DOCUMENTATION - PCC 
Background 
Communication and documentation in PCC are linked priorities as they are activities that are synergistic. For 
instance, the standard documentation forms (see below) that are used to track the important medical 
interventions and trends are the recommended scripts that are used in a teleconsultation. Effective 
documentation leads to effective communication, both in the immediate PCC environment and as a long-term 
medical management tool for the casualty. 
Communication 
 Communicate with the casualty if possible. Encourage, reassure, and explain care. 
 Communicate with tactical leadership as soon as possible and throughout casualty treatment as needed. 
Provide leadership with casualty status and evacuation requirements to assist with coordination of 
evacuation assets. 
 Verify evacuation request has been transmitted and establish communication with the evacuation 
platform as soon as tactically feasible relaying: mechanism of injury, injuries sustained, signs/symptoms, 
treatments rendered, and other information as appropriate. Have a rehearsed script to relay vital 
information to the next echelon of care prioritize interventions that cannot be seen by the next 
provider, such as medications. 
 Ensure appropriate notification up the chain of command that PCC is being conducted; requesting 
support based on the MASCAL decision points. 
 Call for teleconsultation as early and as often as needed (e.g., higher medical capability in the Chain of 
Command, the Advanced VIrtual Support for OpeRational Forces system line, etc.). 
 Remember, communication of the situation and medical interventions that have been done and are 
ongoing includes both teleconsultation and the “handoff report.” 
Documentation of Care 
 There are 3 levels of documentation, categorized in a minimum, better, best format: 
 
Minimum - Documentation of care on the TCCC card (DD1380). 
 
Better - Utilization of a standard PCC flowsheet (if available), example attached. 
 
Best - Completion of a formal After Action Report (AAR) after patient handoff. 
 Transfer documented clinical assessments and treatments rendered. If the availably to scan and/or 
transmit this information to all parties involved teleconsultation (using all approved and available 
means), do so for them to have as much of the information as possible. 
 Perform a detailed head-to-toe assessment and record all findings as a problem list so that a 
comprehensive care plan can then be constructed using the attached flow sheet.

HYPOTHERMIA - PCC 
Background 
Prevention of hypothermia must be emphasized in combat operations and casualty management at all 
levels of care. Hypothermia occurs regardless of the ambient temperature; hypothermia can, and does, 
occur in both hot and cold climates. Because of the difficulty, time, and energy required to actively rewarm casualties, significant attention must be paid to preventing hypothermia from occurring in the first 
place. Prevention of hypothermia is much easier than treatment of hypothermia; therefore prevention 
of heat loss should start as soon as possible after the injury. This is optimally accomplished in a layered 
fashion with rugged, lightweight, durable products that are located as close as possible to the point of 
injury, and then utilized at all subsequent levels of care, including ground and air evacuation, through all 
levels of care. 12

Complete Basic TCCC Management Plan for Hypothermia then: 
Role 1a 
 Take early and aggressive steps to prevent further body heat loss and add 
external heat when possible for both trauma and severely burned casualties. 
 Minimize casualty’s exposure to cold ground, wind and air temperatures. 
Place insulation material between the casualty and any cold surface as soon 
as possible. 
 Keep protective gear on or with the casualty, if feasible. 
 Replace wet clothing with dry clothing, if possible, and protect from further 
heat loss. If unable to replace the dry clothing, wrap an impermeable layer 
around the casualty. 
 Place an active heating blanket on the casualty’s anterior torso and under the 
arms in the axillae. 
 Caution: DO NOT place any active external heating directly on the skin or 
in areas of skin which are under pressure or have poor blood flow as this 
increases risk of injury and/or skin burns. 
 Enclose the casualty with the exterior impermeable enclosure bag, if 
available. 
 Protect the casualty from exposure to wind and precipitation on any 
evacuation platform. 
 
 
 
 
Role 1b 
 Continue and/or initiate above hypothermia interventions. 
 Pre-stage an insulated hypothermia enclosure system with external active 
heating for transition from the non-insulated hypothermia enclosure systems; 
seek to improve upon existing enclosure system when possible. 
 Upgrade hypothermia enclosure system to a well-insulated enclosure system 
using a hooded sleeping bag or other readily available insulation inside the 
enclosure bag/external vapor barrier shell. 
 Best: Improvised hypothermia wrap with high-quality insulation with coldrated sleeping bag combined with heat source, internal vapor barrier, 
outer impermeable enclosure. 
 When using the Hypothermia Prevention and Management Kit (HPMK) readyheat-blanket, perform frequent skin checks to monitor for contact burns. 
 Protect the casualty from exposure to wind and precipitation on any 
evacuation platform.

HYPERTHERMIA - PCC 
Background 
1. Hyperpyrexia is elevated body temperature. 
2. Fever is elevated body temperature in response to a change in hypothalamic set point 
(infections). 
3. Hyperthermia is elevated body temperature without a change in hypothalamic set point (heat 
illness, hyperthyroid, drugs). 
4. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that heat flows from hot to cold. 
5. Heat transfer can occur through several processes: 
a. Radiation 
b. Conduction 
c. Convection 
d. Evaporation 
Heat exhaustion 
Symptoms: weak, dizzy, nauseated, headache, sweating, normal mental status. Heat exhaustion requires 
replacement of fluids and electrolytes. 
Heat stroke 
Symptoms: Hyperthermia + mental status changes. Heat stroke requires immediate cooling.

HEAD INJURY/TBI - PCC 
Background 
TBI occurs when external mechanical forces impact the head and cause an acceleration/deceleration of 
the brain within the cranial vault which results in injury to brain tissue. TBI may be closed (blunt or blast 
trauma) or open (penetrating trauma). 13 Signs and symptoms of TBI are highly variable and depend on 
the specific areas of the brain affected and the injury severity. Alteration in consciousness and focal 
neurologic deficits are common. Various forms of intracranial hemorrhage, such as epidural hematoma, 
subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic contusion can be components of TBI. 
The vast majority of TBIs are categorized as mild and are not considered life threatening; however, it is 
important to recognize this injury because if a patient is exposed to a second head injury while still 
recovering from a mild TBI, they are at risk for increased long-term cognitive effects. Moderate and 
severe TBIs are life-threatening injuries. 
Pre-deployment, Mission Planning, and Training Considerations 
1. Conduct unit level TTD/Titer testing and develop an operational roster. 
2. Conduct baseline neurocognitive assessment per Service guideline. 
3. When possible and practical, keep patient in an elevated orientation to approximately 
30 degrees while maintaining C-spine precautions (as clinically indicated) and airway control 
(don’t just elevate the head by bending the neck). 
4. Define CSWB distribution quantities in area of responsibility. 
5. Determine feasibility and requirement for pre-deployment unit level blood draw. 
6. Conduct unit level pre-deployment blood draw as required. 
7. Ensure critical head-injury adjunct medications appropriately stocked and storage requirements 
met.

PAIN MANAGEMENT (ANALGESIA AND SEDATION) FOR PCC 
Background 
A provider of PCC must first and foremost be an expert in TCCC and then be able to identify all the 
potential issues associated with providing analgesia with or without sedation for a prolonged (4-48 hr.) 
period. 
These PCC pain management guidelines are intended to be used after TCCC Guidelines at the Role 1 
setting, when evacuation to higher level of care is not immediately possible. They attempt to decrease 
complexity by minimizing options for monitoring, medications, and the like, while prioritizing experience 
with a limited number of options versus recommending many different options for a more customized 
fashion. Furthermore, it does not address induction of anesthesia before airway management (i.e. rapid 
sequence intubation). 
Remember, YOU CAN ALWAYS GIVE MORE, but it is very difficult to take away. Therefore, it is easier to 
prevent cardiorespiratory depression by being patient and methodical. TITRATE TO EFFECT. 
Priorities of Care Related to Analgesia and Sedation 
1. Keep the casualty alive. DO NOT give analgesia and/or sedation if there are other priorities of 
care (e.g., hemorrhage control). 
2. Sustain adequate physiology to maintain perfusion. DO NOT give medications that lower blood 
pressure or suppress respiration if the patient is in shock or respiratory distress (or is at 
significant risk of developing either condition). 
3. Manage pain appropriately (based on the pain categories below). 
4. Maintain safety. Agitation and anxiety may cause patients to do unwanted things (e.g., remove 
devices, fight, fall). Sedation may be needed to maintain patient safety and/or operational 
control of the environment (i.e. in the back of an evacuation platform). 
5. Stop awareness. During painful procedures, and during some mission requirements, amnesia 
may be desired. If appropriate, disarm or clear their weapons and prevent access to munitions/ 
mission essential communications. 
General Principles 
 Consider pain in three categories: 
1. Background: the pain that is present because of an injury or wound. This should be managed 
to keep a patient comfortable at rest but should not impair breathing, circulation, or mental 
status. 
2. Breakthrough: the acute pain induced with movement or manipulation. This should be 
managed as needed. If breakthrough pain occurs often or while at rest, pain medication 
should be increased in dose or frequency as clinically prudent but within the limits of safety 
for each medication. 
3. Procedural: the acute pain associated with a procedure. This should be anticipated and a 
plan for dealing with it should be considered. 
Prolonged Casualty Care Guidelines 
CPG ID: 91 
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 
31 
 Analgesia is the alleviation of pain and should be the primary focus of using these medications 
(treat pain before considering sedation). However, not every patient requires (or should receive) 
analgesic medication at first, and unstable patients may require other therapies or resuscitation 
before the administration of pain or sedation medications. 
 Sedation is used to relieve agitation or anxiety and, in some cases, induce amnesia. The most 
common causes of agitation are untreated pain or other serious physiologic problems like 
hypoxia, hypotension, or hypoglycemia. Sedation is used most commonly to ensure patient 
safety (e.g., when agitation is not controlled by analgesia and there is need for the patient to 
remain calm to avoid movement that might cause unintentional tube, line, dressing, splint, or 
other device removal or to allow a procedure to be performed) or to obtain patient amnesia to 
an event (e.g., forming no memory of a painful procedure or during paralysis for ventilator 
management). 
 In a Role 1 (or PCC) setting, intravenous (IV) or interosseous (IO) medication delivery is preferred 
over intramuscular (IM) therapies. The IV/IO route is more predictable in terms of doseresponse relationship. 
 Each patient responds differently to medications, particularly with respect to dose. Some 
individuals require substantially more opioid, benzodiazepine, or ketamine; some require 
significantly less. Once you have a “feel” for how much medication a patient requires, you can 
be more comfortable giving it to patient with a broad range of injuries. 
 Similar amounts during redosing. In general, a single medication will achieve its desired effect if 
enough is given; however, the higher the dose, the more likely the side effects. 
 Additionally, ketamine, opioids, and benzodiazepines given together have a synergistic effect: 
the effect of medications given together is much greater than a single medication given alone 
(i.e., the effect is multiplied, not added, so go with less than what you might normally use if each 
were given alone). 
 Pain medications should be given when feasible after injury or as soon as possible after the 
management of MARCH and appropriately documented (medication administered, dose, route 
and time). Factors for delayed pain management (other than Combat Pill Pack) are need for 
individual to maintain a weapon/security and inability to disarm the patient. 
 PCC requires a different treatment approach than TCCC. Go slowly, use lower doses of 
medication, titrate to effect, and re-dose more frequently. This will provide more consistent 
pain control and sedation. High doses may result in dramatic swings between over sedation with 
respiratory suppression and hypotension alternating with agitation and emergence 
phenomenon. 
Drips and Infusions 
For IV/IO drip medications: Use normal saline to mix medication drips when possible, but other 
crystalloids (e.g., lactated Ringer’s, Plasmalyte, and so forth) may be used if normal saline is not 
available. DO NOT mix more than one medication in the same bag of crystalloid. Mixing medications 
together, even for a relatively short time, may cause changes to the chemical structure of one or both 
medications and could lead to toxic compounds. 
If a continuous drip is selected, use only a ketamine drip in most situations, augmented by push doses of 
opioid and/or midazolam if needed. Multiple drips are difficult to manage and should only be 
undertaken with assistance from a Teleconsultation with critical care experience. Multiple drips are 
Prolonged Casualty Care Guidelines 
CPG ID: 91 
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 
32 
most likely to be helpful in patients who remain difficult to sedate with ketamine drip alone and can 
“smooth out” the sedation (e.g., fewer peaks and troughs of sedation with corresponding deep sedation 
mixed with periods of acute agitation). 
Other medications that should be available when providing narcotic pain control is Naloxone. If the 
patient receives too much medication, consider dilution of 0. 4mg of naloxone in 9ml saline (40mcg/mL) 
and administer 40mcg IV/IO PRN to increase respiratory rate, but still maintaining pain control. 
The PCC Pain Management Guideline Tables 
These tables are intended to be a quick reference guide but are not standalone: you must know the 
information in the rest of the guideline. The tables are arranged according to anticipated clinical 
conditions, corresponding goals of care, and the capabilities needed to provide effective analgesia and 
sedation according to the minimum standard, a better option when mission and equipment support (all 
medics should be trained to this standard), and the best option that may only be available in the event a 
medic has had additional training, experience, and/or available equipment. 
Medications in the table are presented as either give or consider: 
 Give: Strongly recommended. 
 Consider: Requires a complete assessment of patient condition, environment, risks, benefits, 
equipment, and provider training. 
Use these steps when referencing the tables: 
Step 1. Identify the clinical condition 
 Standard analgesia is for most patients. The therapies used here are the foundation for pain 
management during PCC. Expertise in dosing fentanyl (OTFC or IV) and ketamine IV or IO is a 
must. Intramuscular and intranasal dosing of medications isn’t recommended in a PCC 
setting. 
 Difficult analgesia or sedation needed is for patients in whom standard analgesia does not 
achieve adequate pain control without suppressing respiratory drive or causing hypotension, 
OR when mission requirements necessitate sedating a patient to gain control over their 
actions to achieve patient safety, quietness, or necessary positioning. 
 Protected airway with mechanical ventilation is for patients who have a protected airway and 
are receiving mechanical ventilatory support or are receiving full respiratory support via 
assisted ventilation (i.e. bag valve). 
 Shock present is for patients who have hypotension, active hemorrhage, and/or tachycardia. 
Step 2. Read down the column to the row representing your available resources and training. 
Step 3. Provide analgesia/sedation medication accordingly. 
Step 4. Consider using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score (Appendix E) as a method to 
trend the patient’s sedation level.

 Pain meds that are initiated in TCCC can often be continued in the PCC environment for both 
ongoing analgesia and sedation, as long as the duration and cumulative side effects are well 
understood and mitigated.

Special Considerations 
Patient Monitoring During Sedation 
Patients receiving analgesia and sedation require close monitoring for life-threatening side-effects of 
medications. 
 Minimum: Blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, pulse oximeter; document vital signs trends. 
 Better: Capnography in addition to minimum requirements 
 Best: Portable monitor providing continuous vital signs display and capnography; document vital 
signs trends frequently. 
Analgesia and Sedation for Expectant Care (i.e. End-of-Life Care) 
An unfortunate reality of our profession, both military and medical, is that we encounter clinical 
scenarios that will inevitably end in a patient’s death. In these situations, it is a healthcare provider’s 
obligation to give palliative therapy to minimize the person’s suffering. In these circumstances, the use 
of opioid analgesics and sedative medications is therapeutic and indicated, even if these medications 
worsen a patient’s vital signs (i.e., cause respiratory depression and/or hypotension). If a patient is 
expectant: 
 Teleconsultation 
 Prepare to: 
 
Give opioid until the patient’s pain is relieved. If the patient is unable to communicate their 
pain, give opioid medication until the respiratory rate is less than 20/min. 
 
If the patient complains of feeling anxious (i.e., is worrying about the future but not 
complaining of pain) or he cannot express himself but is agitated despite having a 
respiratory rate less than 20/min, give a benzodiazepine until the anxiety is relieved or the 
patient is sedated (i.e., is not feeling anxious or is no longer agitated). 
 Position the patient as comfortably as possible. Pad pressure points. 
 Provide anything that gives the patient comfort (e.g., water, food, cigarette). 
 Under no circumstances should paralytics be used without analgesia/sedation

ANTIBIOTICS, SEPSIS, AND OTHER DRUGS - PCC 
Background 
Complete Basic TCCC Management Plan for Antibiotics then: 
Antibiotics should be given immediately after injury or as soon as possible after the management of 
MARCH and Pain Management and appropriately documented (medication administered, dose, route 
and time). 
Confirm that initial TCCC dose of moxifloxacin (Avelox®) or Ertapenem (Invanz®) have already been given 
for any penetrating trauma. If available, administer tetanus toxoid IM as soon as possible. 
Antibiotics should be given daily for seven to 10 days, depending on the type of antibiotic given (see 
below tables for antibiotics). When able/available, transition IV/IO antibiotics to PO as soon as possible 
to conserve supplies and equipment. 
Table 11. TCCC Antibiotics 
TCCC Antibiotics 
Moxifloxacin (Avelox®) 
Administer 400mg PO daily for 10 days 
Ertapenem (Invanz®)

 LR or NS to maintain SBP > 90mmHg or MAP ≥ 65 mmHg 
 If plasma is being given that volume can count toward the 30 ml/kg goal 
 Best - The same fluid resuscitation strategy as above with the addition of a urinary 
catheter for more precise measuring of UOP 
Vasopressors 
 After fluid resuscitation, if there is no observed positive change in SBP, MAP, UOP and/or 
mental status, vasopressor medications should be given 
 All use of pressers should be administered by role-based approved protocols or 
teleconsultation approval 
 First-line - norepinephrine infusion 
 Second-line - epinephrine infusion 
 Refer to Drip table below for preparation, starting dose, and drip rates 
Additional 
Medications 
 Consider hydrocortisone or dexamethasone administration for possible adrenal 
insufficiency if there is a poor response to vasopressor initiation/titration 
 
Administer antipyretics (acetaminophen, if available. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory

**This is the least recommended approach as it commits a high volume of epinephrine to a large bag. If 
the patient’s vital signs (BP/MAP/HR) stabilize, the bag must be discontinued and the medic risks 
wasting some of their resources – “you can mix a drug in an IV bag, but you can’t take it out.” 
Ancillary Medications 
During PCC, additional medications may be required during the extended treatment of casualties, in 
addition to pain and antibiotic medications. These medications may have synergistic effects to further 
reduce pain or fever. Some medications may be utilized to treat side-effects of medications, to include 
nausea or other GI related issues. 
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis is also recommended for patients that are expected to be in a 
PCC setting for greater than 48 hours that have achieved hemostasis from wounds or are not at risk for 
further hemorrhage.

WOUND CARE AND NURSING - PCC 
Background 
Nursing interventions may not appear important to the medical professionals caring for a patient, but 
such interventions greatly reduce the possibility of complications such as DVT, pneumonia, pressure 
sores, wound infection, and urinary tract infection; therefore, essential nursing and wound care should 
be prioritized in the training environment. Critically ill and injured casualties are at high risk for 
complications that can lead to adverse outcomes such as increased disability and death. Nursing care is 
a core principle of PCC to reduce the risk of preventable complications and can be provided without 
costly or burdensome equipment. 20 
 Using a nursing care checklist assists with developing a schedule for performing appropriate 
assessments and interventions. 
 Cross training all team members on these interventions prior to deployment will lessen the 
demand on the medic, especially when caring for more than one patient. 
 Prolonged Casualty Care Flowsheets, Nursing Care Checklists, Nursing Care Plans, 
Assessment/Intervention Packing List, and Recommended Nursing Skill Checklist for Clinical 
Rotations are included as a PCC Guidelines Appendix. (Also located in JTS Nursing Intervention in 
Prolonged Field Care CPG, 22 Jul 2018 18). 
Pre-deployment, Mission Planning, and Training Considerations 
 Hands-on experience is optimal; simulation is a reasonable substitute 
 Practice with minimal technology so you are prepared when you lose access to electricity, water 
 Regular monitoring, reassessment, and intervention is lifesaving but can be resource-intensive 
 Utilize the Recommended Nursing Skill Checklist for Clinical Rotations included in Appendix B to 
maximize training opportunities.

BURN TREATMENT - PCC 
Background 
 Interrupt the burning process 
 Address any life-threatening process based on MARCH assessment as directed by TCCC. 
 A burned trauma casualty is a trauma casualty first 
 All TCCC skills can be performed through burned tissue 
Burn Characteristics 
 Superficial burns (1st degree) appear red, do not blister, and blanch readily. 
 Partial thickness burns (2nd degree) are moist and sensate, blister, and blanch. 
 Full thickness burns (3rd degree) appear leathery, dry, non-blanching, are insensate, and often 
contain thrombosed vessels

the primary and secondary survey should be addressed as per standard trauma protocols 
 Avoid becoming distracted by the appearance of burned tissues. 
 
 
Intervention 
Paradigm 
 
 
Airway 
(Roles 
1a/1b/1c) 
 Minimum - Allow casualty to maintain airway. 
 Better - Facial burns may be associated with inhalation injury. 
Aggressively monitor airway status and place the casualty in a recovery 
position IAW TCCC Guidelines. 
 Best - Given a trauma casualty who is unresponsive or has an airway 
obstruction, perform a Head-Tilt Chin Lift or Jaw-thrust maneuver to 
open the airway in accordance with TCCC guidelines. 
 
 
Fluid 
Resuscitation 
(Roles 
1a/1b/1c) 
 Estimate body total surface area (TBSA) burned using the Rule of Nines 
initially (DD Form 1380).

IV/IO access is established. 
 Minimum - Oral intake of water 
 Better - Oral intake of electrolyte solution 
 Best - Oral intake of electrolyte solution 
 
 
Hypothermia 
(Roles 
1a/1b/1c) 
 Hypothermia prevention is extremely important for burn patients. 
 For Burns >20%, place the casualty in the Heat-Reflective Shell or 
Blizzard Survival blanket for the Hypothermia Prevention Kit to both 
cover the burned areas and prevent hypothermia.

Pain Control 
Analgesia in accordance with the PCC Guidelines may be administered 
to treat burn pain. 
 
 
Wounds 
(Roles 1a/1b) 
 Minimum - Cover with clean sheet or dry gauze. Leave blisters intact. 
Avoid wet dressings. 
 Better - Clean wounds by washing with any clean water (preferably with 
antibacterial soap if available), dress wounds with any available 
dressings; optimize wound and patient hygiene to the extent possible 
given the environment. 
 Best - Clean wounds by scrubbing gently with gauze and clean water, 
followed by gauze dressing. 
 
 
Wounds 
(Role 1c) 
 Best - Clean wounds by scrubbing gently with gauze and chlorhexidine 
gluconate solution (if available) in clean water, followed by gauze 
dressing. Repeat daily. 
 Monitor vital signs. 
 
 
 Ensure all interventions noted above are completed by TCCC ASM and CLS personnel. 
 Conduct inventory of all resources.

 Additional interventions include: 
 
 
Intervention 
Paradigm 
 
 
Airway 
(Roles 
1a/1b/1c) 
 Minimum - Allow casualty to maintain airway. 
 Better - Facial burns may be associated with inhalation injury. 
Aggressively monitor airway status and consider early surgical airway for 
respiratory distress or oxygen saturation and/or EtCO2 (purple-gold 
colorimetric device). 
 Best - Given a trauma casualty who is unresponsive or has an airway 
obstruction, consider early surgical airway. 
 
 
Fluid 
Resuscitation 
(Roles 
1a/1b/1c) 
 Minimum - Oral intake of water. Rectal infusion of up to 500mL/h can 
be supplemented with oral hydration. 
 Better - Oral intake of electrolyte solution. 
 Best - Start intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO) administration 
immediately. NOTE - an IV/IO can be placed through burned skin if 
necessary. 
 Use isotonic crystalloids (i.e. Lactated Ringers). 
 DO NOT circumferentially tape lines around extremities; this may 
further impede circulation and cause limb ischemia as extremities swell 
during resuscitation. 
 NO bolus (unless hypotensive, in which case, bolus only until palpable 
pulses are restored). 
 Initial IV rate 500mL/h; start while completing initial assessment 
 Give fluids per TCCC burn treatment guidelines. 
 If resuscitation is delayed, DO NOT try to “catch up” by giving extra 
fluids. 
 Blood products may be used in major burn resuscitation due to 
coagulopathy, anemia, and bleeding from escharotomy sites or other 
traumatic injuries. 
 Maintain a UOP of 30-50mL/hr. in adults; decrease or increase isotonic 
fluid rate by 20-25% per hour. 
 If UOP > 50 mL/hr., then decrease the fluid rate by 20-25% for the next 
hour and reassess. 
 Minimize fluid administration while maintaining organ perfusion; hourto-hour fluid management is critical. 
Prolonged Casualty Care Guidelines 
CPG ID: 91 
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 
49 
 8-12 hours post-burn, if the hourly IV fluid rate exceeds 1500mL/hr. or if 
the projected 24- hour total fluid volume approaches 250 mL/kg consult 
burn team or medical director. 
 24–48 hours post burn, plasma is lost into the burned and unburned 
tissues, causing hypovolemic shock (when burn size is >20%). The goal of 
burn-shock resuscitation is to replace these ongoing losses while 
avoiding over-resuscitation. 
 48-72 hours post-burn, completion of the resuscitation is marked by 
stabilizing hemodynamic parameters and reduction of IV fluid rate to a 
maintenance level. 
 
 
Hypothermia 
(Roles 
1a/1b/1c) 
 Hypothermia prevention is extremely important for burn patients. 
 For Burns >20%, place the casualty in the Heat-Reflective Shell or 
Blizzard Survival blanket for the Hypothermia Prevention Kit to both 
cover the burned areas and prevent hypothermia. 
 Use Blood/Fluid Warmer as needed and if available. 
 
 
 
Pain Control 
(Roles 
1a/1b/1c) 
Analgesia in accordance with the PCC Guidelines may be administered to 
treat burn pain. 
 
 
 
Medications 
(Roles 1a/1b) 
 Prophylactic antibiotics (oral or IV) are not indicated for burn injury in 
the absence of infection. 
 Penetrating wounds or open fractures should be treated with antibiotics 
according to current TCCC guidelines. 
 
 
Medications 
(Role 1c) 
 After several days, if the patient develops cellulitis (spreading erythema 
around edges of burn), treat for gram-positive organisms, (e.g., cefazolin 
or clindamycin). 
 If patient develops invasive burn wound infection (signs: sepsis/septic 
shock, changes in color of wound, possible foul smell of wound), treat 
with broad-spectrum antibiotics. 
 
 
Wounds 
(Role 1a) 
 Minimum - Cover with clean sheet or dry gauze. Leave blisters intact. 
Avoid wet dressings. 
 Better - Clean wounds by washing with any clean water (preferably with 
antibacterial soap if available), dress wounds with any available 
dressings; optimize wound and patient hygiene to the extent possible 
given the environment. 
 Best - Clean wounds by scrubbing gently with gauze and clean water, 
followed by gauze dressing. 
 DO NOT debride blisters until the patient has reached a facility with 
surgical capability. 
 Every patient with facial burns should have a thorough eye exam. 
Conduct an eye exam early, before edema begins. 
 If a corneal injury is identified, use a rigid shield to cover the eyes and 
apply ophthalmic erythromycin or neomycin ointment every 
2 hours. 
 
 
Wounds 
(Roles 1b/1c) 
 Better - Clean wounds and debride loose skin by washing with any clean 
water (preferably with antibacterial soap if available), dress wounds 
with any available dressings; optimize wound and patient hygiene to the 
extent possible given the environment. 
 Best - Clean wounds by scrubbing gently with gauze and chlorhexidine 
gluconate solution (if available) in clean water, apply topical 
antimicrobial cream followed by gauze dressing.

Monitoring 
 Monitor vital signs and urine output (UOP) closely. 
 Minimum - Use other measures If unable to measure UOP, adjust IV 
rate to maintain HR less than 140, palpable peripheral pulses, good 
capillary refill, intact mental status. 
 Better - Capture all spontaneously voided urine in premade or 
improvised (i.e. Nalgene® water bottle) graduated cylinder; >180mL 
every 6 hours is adequate for adults. 
 Best - Measure UOP with Foley catheter (burns to the penis are NOT a 
contraindication to catheter placement). 
 
 
 
 Ensure all above interventions are completed by TCCC ASM, CLS and CMC personnel. 
 Conduct inventory of all resources. 
 Document all pertinent information on PCC Flowsheet (attached.) 
 Additional interventions include:

Paradigm 
 
 
 
 
Airway 
(Roles 
1a/1b/1c) 
 Minimum - Allow casualty to maintain airway. Edema after burn injury 
causes most supraglottic airway devices such as LMAs to be inadequate. 
 Better - Facial burns may be associated with inhalation injury. 
Aggressively monitor airway status and consider early surgical airway for 
respiratory distress or oxygen saturation and/or EtCO2 (purple-gold 
colorimetric device). 
 Best - Indications for endotracheal intubation include: a comatose 
patient, symptomatic inhalation injury, deep facial burns, and burns 
over 40% TBSA. 
 Utilize an EMMA (or other Capnography) EtCO2 device if possible. 
 Use a large-bore endotracheal tube if inhalation injury is suspected 
(Size 8 ETT or larger is preferred for adults). 
 Secure ETT with cotton umbilical ties (standard adhesive ETT holders 
do not work around burned skin). 
 Frequently reassess position of the ETT during the acute resuscitation 
period as edema waves and wanes.

Special Considerations in Burn Injuries 
Chemical Burns 
NOTE: Refer to the JTS Inhalation Injury and Toxic Industrial Chemical Exposure CPG for additional 
information. 
 Expose body surfaces, brush off dry chemicals, and copiously irrigate with clean water. Large 
volume (>20L) serial irrigations may be needed to thoroughly cleanse the skin of residual agents. 
Do not attempt to neutralize any chemicals on the skin. 
 Use personal protective equipment to minimize exposure of medical personnel to chemical 
agents. 
 White phosphorous fragments ignite when exposed to air. Clothing may contain white 
phosphorous residue and should be removed. Fragments embedded in the skin and soft tissue 
should be irrigated out if possible or kept covered with soaking wet saline dressings or 
hydrogels. 
 Seek early consultation from the USAISR Burn Center (DSN 312-429-2876 (BURN); Commercial 
(210) 916-2876 or (210) 222-2876; email burntrauma.consult.army@mail.mil). 
Electrical Burns 
 TCCC ASM and CLS personnel should remove the patient from the electricity source while 
avoiding injury themselves. 
 For cardiac arrest due to arrhythmia after electrical injury, follow advanced cardiac life support 
(ACLS) protocol and provide hemodynamic monitoring if spontaneous circulation returns. 
 Small skin contact points (cutaneous burns) can hide extensive soft tissue damage. 
 Observe the patient closely for clinical signs of compartment syndrome. 
 Tissue that is obviously necrotic must be surgically debrided. 
NOTE: Escharotomy, which relieves the tourniquet effect of circumferential burns, will not necessarily 
relieve elevated muscle compartment pressure due to myonecrosis associated with electrical injury; 
therefore, fasciotomy is usually required. 
 Compartment syndrome and muscle injury may lead to rhabdomyolysis, causing pigmenturia 
and renal injury. 
 Pigmenturia typically presents as red-brown urine. In patients with pigmenturia, fluid 
resuscitation requirements are much higher than those predicted for a similar-sized thermal 
burn. 
 Isotonic fluid infusion should be adjusted to maintain UOP 75-100 mL/hr. in adult patients with 
pigmenturia. 
 If the pigmenturia does not clear after several hours of resuscitation consider IV infusion of 
mannitol, 12. 5 g per liter of lactated Ringer’s solution, and/or sodium bicarbonate (150 mEq/L in 
D5W). These infusions may be given empirically; it is not necessary to monitor urinary pH. In 
patients receiving mannitol (an osmotic diuretic), close monitoring of intravascular status via 
CVP and other parameters is required. 
Prolonged Casualty Care Guidelines 
CPG ID: 91 
Guideline Only/Not a Substitute for Clinical Judgment 
52 
 Seek early consultation from the USAISR Burn Center (DSN 312-429-2876 (BURN); Commercial 
(210) 916-2876 or (210) 222-2876; email burntrauma.consult.army@mail.mil). 
Pediatric Burn Injuries 
 Children with acute burns over 15% of the body surface usually require a calculated 
resuscitation. 
 Place a bladder catheter if available (size 6 Fr for infants and 8 Fr for most small children). 
 The Modified Brooke formula (3 mL/kg/%TBSA LR or other isotonic fluid divided over 24 hours, 
with one-half given during the first 8 hours) is a reasonable starting point. This only provides a 
starting point for resuscitation, which must be adjusted based on UOP and other indicators of 
organ perfusion. Goal UOP for children is 0. 5-1mL/kg/hr. 
 Very young children do not have adequate glycogen stores to sustain themselves during 
resuscitation. Administer a maintenance rate of D5LR to children weighing < 20 kg. Utilize the 42-1 rule: 4ml/kg for the first 10kg + 2ml/kg 2nd 10kg + 1ml/kg over 20kg. 
 In children with burns > 30% TBSA, early administration may reduce overall resuscitation 
volume. 
 Monitor resuscitation in children, like adults, based on physical examination, input and output 
measurements, and analysis of laboratory data. 
 The well-resuscitated child should have alert sensorium, palpable pulses, and warm distal 
extremities; urine should be glucose negative. 
 Cellulitis is the most common infectious complication and usually presents within 5 days of 
injury. Prophylactic antibiotics do not diminish this risk and should not be used unless other 
injuries require antimicrobial coverage (penetrating injury or open fracture). 
 Most antistreptococcal antibiotics such as penicillin are successful in eradicating infection. Initial 
parenteral administration is advised for most children presenting with fever or systemic toxicity. 
 Nutrition is critical for pediatric burn patients. Nasogastric feeding may be started immediately 
at a low rate in hemodynamically stable patients and tolerance monitored. Start with a standard 
pediatric enteral formula (i.e. Pediasure) targeting 30-35 kcal/kg/day and 2g/kg/day of protein. 
 Children may rapidly develop tolerance to analgesics and sedatives; dose escalation is 
commonly required. Ketamine and propofol are useful procedural adjuncts. 
 When burned at a young age, many children will develop disabling contractures. These are often 
very amenable to correction which may be performed in theater with adequate staff and 
resources. 
 Seek early consultation from the USAISR Burn Center (DSN 312-429-2876 (BURN); Commercial 
(210) 916-2876 or (210) 222-2876; email burntrauma.consult.army@mail.mil). 
 Opportunities for pediatric surgical care provided by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) 
may be the best option but require the coordinated efforts of the military, host nation, and 
NGOs.

53 
Rule of Nines 
On the DD Form 1380 the percentage of coverage on the casualty’s body will need to be documented. 
The Rule of Nines will help with the estimation. The below figure shows the approximation for each area 
of the body: 
 Eleven areas each have 9% body surface area (head, upper extremities, front and backs of lower 
extremities, and front and back of the torso having two 9% areas each). 
 General guidelines are that the size of the palm of the hand represents approximately 1% of the 
burned area. 
 When estimating, it is easiest to round up to the nearest 10. 
 If half of the front or rear area is burned, the area would be half of the area value. 
 For example, if half of the front upper/lower extremity is burned, it would be half of 9%, or 
4. 5%. If half of the front torso is burned, say either the upper or lower part of the front torso, 
then it would be half of 18%, or 9%. 
 Remember, the higher the percentage burned, the higher the chance for hypothermia. 
 For children, the percentage of BSA is calculated differently due to the distinctive proportion of 
major areas.

LOGISTICS - PCC 
Background 
Reducing the time to required medical or surgical interventions prevents death in potentially survivable 
illness, injuries and wounds. When evacuation times are extended, en route care (ERC) capability must 
be adequately expanded to mitigate the delay. In January 2010, the Joint Force Health Protection Joint 
Patient Movement Report stated “the current success of the medical community is colored by the 
valiant ability to overcome deficiencies through ‘just-in-time workarounds;’ many systemic shortfalls are 
resolved and become transparent to patient outcomes. However, future operations may not tolerate 
current deficiencies.” 24 
 Patient packaging is highly dependent upon the transportation or evacuation platform that is 
available 
 If possible, rehearse patient packaging internally and with the external resources. 
 Train with all possible assets, familiarizing them with standard operating procedures 
 Ensure the patient is stable before initiating a critical patient transfer

 Minimum - Secure and reinforce dressings with tape, date, and time all dressings. 
 Better - Change dressings within 24 hours of departure, secure as above. 
 Best - Change and reinforce dressings within 4 hours of departure. Ensure additional Class 
VIII is available for any unforeseen issues in flight. 
 CAUTION - Circumferential/constricting dressings MUST be limited/monitored due to 
swelling during prolonged aerial transport. 
Secure the Patient 
 Minimum - Litter with minimum of 2 litter straps. 
 Better - Litter with padding (example: AE pad or Sleep Mat) with minimum of 3 litter 
straps. 
 Best - Litter with padding and flight approved litter headrest with minimum of 3 litter 
straps. 
 Additional litter straps can be used to secure patient or equipment. 
Moving a Critical 
Care Patient 
 Minimum - Two-person litter carry to CASEVAC/MEDEVAC platform. 
 Better - Three-person litter carry to CASEVAC/MEDEVAC platform. 
 Best - Four-person litter carry to CASEVAC/MEDEVAC platform.

APPENDIX C: MASCAL RESOURCES 
Triage Guiding Principles 
 Priorities change based on time from injury 
 Activities in first hour are CRITICAL 
 Don’t waste time with formal triage tools 
Just extricate/stop threat, stop external bleeding, clear airway 
 Transfusion and ventilator support within the first hour identify a resource-intensive patient 
 Damage control surgery has little impact after the first hour

67 
APPENDIX E: TBI RESOURCES 
Neurological Examination 
MENTAL STATUS 
Level of Consciousness: Note whether the patient is: 
 
Alert/responsive 
 
Not alert but arouses to verbal stimulation 
 
Not alert but responds to painful stimulation 
 
Unresponsive 
Orientation: Assess the patient’s ability to provide: 
 
Name 
 
Current location 
 
Current date 
 
Current situation (e.g., ask the patient what 
happened to him/her) 
Language: Note the fluency and appropriateness of the 
patient’s response to questions. Note patient’s ability 
to follow commands when assessing other functions 
(e.g., smiling, grip strength, wiggling toes). Ask the 
patient to name a simple object (e.g., thumb, glove, 
watch). 
Speech: Observe for evidence of slurred speech. 
CRANIAL NERVES 
All patients: 
 
Assess the pupillary response to light. 
 
Assess position of the eyes and note any 
movements (e.g., midline, gaze deviated left or 
right, nystagmus, eyes move together versus 
uncoupled movements). 
 
Noncomatose patient: 
 
Test sensation to light touch on both sides of the 
face. 
 
Ask patient to smile and raise eyebrows, and 
observe for symmetry. 
 
Ask the patient to say “Ahhh” and directly observe 
for symmetric palatal elevation. 
 
Comatose patient: 
 
Check corneal reflexes; stimulation should trigger 
eyelid closure. 
 
Observe for facial grimacing with painful stimuli. 
 
Note symmetry and strength. 
 
Directly stimulate the back of the throat and look 
for a gag, tearing, and/or cough. 
MOTOR 
Tone: Note whether resting tone is increased (i.e. 
spastic or rigid), normal, or decreased (flaccid). 
Strength: Observe for spontaneous movement of 
extremities and note any asymmetry of movement 
(i.e. patient moves left side more than right side). 
Lift arms and legs, and note whether the limbs fall 
immediately, drift, or can be maintained against 
gravity. Push and pull against the upper and lower 
extremities and note any resistance given. Note any 
differences in resistance provided between the left 
and right sides. 
(NOTE: it is often difficult to perform formal strength 
testing in TBI patients. Unless the patient is awake 
and cooperative, reliable strength testing is 
difficult.) 
Involuntary movements: Note any involuntary 
movements (e.g., twitching, tremor, myoclonus) 
involving the face, arms, legs, or trunk. 
SENSORY 
If patient is not responsive to voice, test central pain 
and peripheral pain. 
Central pain: Apply a sternal rub or supraorbital 
pressure, and note the response (e.g., extensor 
posturing, flexor posturing, localization). 
Peripheral pain: Apply nail bed pressure or take 
muscle between the fingers, compress, and rotate 
the wrist (do not pinch the skin). Muscle in the 
axillary region and inner thigh is recommended. 
Apply similar stimulus to all four limbs and note the 
response (e.g., extensor posturing, flexor posturing, 
withdrawal, localization). 
NOTE: In an awake and cooperative patient, testing 
light touch is recommended. It is unnecessary to 
apply painful stimuli to an awake and cooperative 
patient. 
GAIT 
If the patient is able to walk, observe his/her casual 
gait and note any instability, drift, sway, and so 
forth.

Ultrasonic Assessment of Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter 
If a patient is unconscious (i.e. does not follow commands or open eyes spontaneously), they may have 
elevated ICP. There is no reliable test for elevated ICP available outside of a hospital; however, optic 
nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement is a rapid, safe, and easy-to-perform ultrasonographic 
assessment that may help identify elevated ICP when more definitive monitoring devices are not 
available. 
 
The optic nerve sheath directly communicates with the intracranial subarachnoid space. Increased 
ICP, therefore, displaces cerebrospinal fluid along this pathway. Normal ONSD is 4. 1–5. 9mm. 30 
 
A 10–5-MHz linear ultrasound probe can be used to obtain ONSDs. ONSD is measured from one side 
of the optic nerve sheath to the other at a distance of 3mm behind the eye immediately below the 
sclera. 31 
 
In general, ONSDs >5. 2mm should raise concern for clinically significant elevations in ICP in 
unconscious TBI patients. 5,32 The ONSD can vary significantly in normal individuals, so one single 
measurement may not be helpful; however, repeated measurements that detect gradual increases 
in ONSD over time may be more useful than a single measurement. 
 
ONSD changes rapidly when the ICP changes, so it can be measured frequently. 33 If ONSD is used, it 
is best to check hourly along with the neurologic examination. 
Technique 
1. Check to make sure there is no eye injury. A penetrating injury to the eyeball is an absolute contraindication to 
ultrasound because it puts pressure on the eye. 
2. Ensure the head and neck are in a midline position. Gentle sedation and/or analgesia may be necessary to 
obtain accurate measurements. 
3. Ensure the eyelids are closed. 
4. If available, place a thin, transparent film (e.g., Tegaderm; 3M, http://www. 3m.com) over the closed eyelids. 
5. Apply a small amount of ultrasound gel to closed eyelid. 
6. Place the 10(–5) MHz linear probe over the eyelid. The probe should be applied in a horizontal orientation 
(Figure 1) with as little pressure as possible applied to the globe. 
7. Manipulate the probe until the nerve and nerve sheath are visible at the bottom of screen. An example of a 
proper ultrasonagraphic image of the optic nerve sheath can be seen in Figure 2. 
8. Once the optic nerve sheath is visualized, freeze the image on the screen. 
9. Using the device’s measuring tool, measure 3mm back from the optic disc and then obtain a second 
measurement perpendicular to the first. The second measurement should cover the horizontal width of the 
optic nerve sheath (Figure 2). An abnormal ONSD is shown in Figure 3. 
10. Repeat the previous sequence in the opposite eye. Annotate both ONSDs on the PFC Casualty Card. 
11. ONSDs should be obtained, when possible, at regular intervals to help assess changes in ICP, particularly when 
the neurologic examination is poor and/or unreliable (i.e. with sedation). Serial measurements with 
progressive diameter enlargement and/or asymmetry in ONSDs should be considered indicative of worsening 
intracranial hypertension. 
CAUTION: ONSD measurements are contraindicated in eye injuries. NEVER apply pressure to an injured eye.

Figure 1. Appropriate placement 
of the linear probe. 
 
 
Ultrasound gel is placed over a closed eyelid 
and the probe placed horizontally over the 
eyelid, applying as little pressure to the 
globe as possible. If available, Tegaderm or 
other thin covering (e.g., Latex glove) should 
be placed over a closed eyelid for further 
protection. 
Figure 2 An ultrasonographic view 
of a normal eye and optic nerve sheath. 
 
To measure ONSD, apply the ultrasound measuring 
device to the optic disc and measure back 3mm 
along the length of the optic nerve. A second, 
perpendicular measurement is obtained at the 
previously measured point that spans the horizontal 
width of the optic nerve sheath. In this image, ONSD 
was determined to be 5. 1mm, a normal value. 
Figure 3. Ultrasound image of the right optic nerve 
sheath of a 61-year-old man with a traumatic 
subdural hematoma. 
 
 
The optic nerve sheath measured 6. 8mm in 
diameter. Elevated ICP was subsequently confirmed 
(26mmHg) after the placement of an ICP bolt 
monitor. 
 
Spontaneous Venous Pulsations 
 
Spontaneous venous pulsations (SVPs) are subtle, rhythmic variations 
in retinal vein caliber on the optic disc and have an association with 
ICP. 
 
It is difficult to see SVPs without advanced equipment; however, if a 
handheld ophthalmoscope is available, it is worth an attempt to 
visualize the retinal veins. 
 
Don’t worry if you cannot see SVPs; this may actually be normal. 
However, if you do see them, it is very reassuring that ICP is 
normal. 10 
 
If SVPs are initially present and can no longer be seen on subsequent 
examinations, the provider should be concerned for increasing ICP. 
Technique 
1. Gently lift the eyelid until the pupil is in view. 
2. Using a handheld ophthalmoscope, the provider should maneuver 
himself or herself to a position where the optic disc can be visualized. 
3. Identify the retinal veins as they emerge from the optic disc. Retinal 
veins are typically slightly larger and darker than retinal arteries. 
Figure at right demonstrates the typical appearance of the retina. 
4. Observe the retinal veins for pulsations. Note the presence or 
absence of spontaneous venous pulsations 
5. Repeat the step 1–4 sequence in the contralateral eye. 
Figure 6. 
Typical appearance of a 
healthy retina. 
 
The retinal vessels can be seen emerging from the optic 
disc. Retinal veins can be identified by their slightly larger, 
thicker size and darker color. Retinal arteries are small, 
thin, and lighter in color than retinal veins.

APPENDIX F: LOGISTICS RESOURCES 
Prolonged Field Care – Patient Packaging, 11 Aug 2021 
Patient packaging is highly dependent upon the Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) / Medical Evacuation 
(MEDEVAC) platform that is operationally available. If possible, rehearse patient packaging internally 
and with the external resources. Train with MEDEVAC assets understand transporting teams’ standard 
operating procedures in order to best prepare the patient for transport. (Example some teams want to 
secure the patient and interventions themselves while others may be okay with a fully wrapped patient). 
Ensure the patient is stable before initiating a critical patient transfer. For POI/unstable patients ensure 
the appropriate transport team (MEDEVAC with en route critical care nurse or advanced provider). 
Interfacility transfers should meet the following minimum: 
1. Hemorrhage control 
2. Resuscitation adequate (SBP 70-80 mmHg, MAP >60, or UOP >0. 5ml/kg/hr) 
3. Initial post-op recovery as indicated 
4. Stabilization of fractures 
Prepare Documentation 
 Good: TCCC Card - DA1380 
 Better: Prolonged Field Care Casualty Work Sheet 
 Best: PFC Card with TCCC Card and any additional information, reference DA Form 4700 (SMOG 
2021) for transport documentation standard 
*preference: secure to patient strip of 3in Tape with medications administered attached to blanket or 
HPMK 
Prepare Report 
Report should give highlights, expected course, and possible complications during transport. The handoff is the most dangerous time for the patient it is as important as treatments or medications. If it is 
rushed things can easily be missed. 
 Good: Verbal report describing the patient from head to toe with a SOAP note. 
 Best: MIST (Mechanism, Interventions, Symptoms, Treatments) 
 Better: MIST with appropriate SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendations) 
and pertinent labs and other diagnostic information 
Prepare Medications 
 Good: Prepare medication list with doses and time of next dose 
 Better: Above with additionally preparing next dose of medication for transport crew 
appropriately labeled. 
 Best: Above with fresh IV fluids if indicated and fresh bags of drip medications with appropriate 
labeling and 72 hours of antibiotic for extended transports.

Hypothermia Management 
 Good: Blankets 
 Better: Sleep system and blankets 
 Best: HPMK with Ready Heat or Absorbent Patient Litter System (APLS) 
Flight Stressor/ Altitude Management 
 Good: Ear Protection and Eye Protection, if nothing available sunglasses and gauze may be used, 
if patient is sedated and intubated eyes can be taped shut 
 Better: Ear Pro and Eye Pro and blankets in all bony areas, Ear Protection and Eye Protection – 
foamies or actual hearing protection inserts, goggles 
 Best: Above with gastric tube (NG/OG) or chest tube for decompression, if indicated. Depending 
on altitude/platform, consider bleeding air of out bags of fluid. 
Secure Interventions and Equipment 
 Good: Tape (securely tape all interventions to include IVs, IOs, Airway interventions, Gastric 
Tubes and TQs). Oxygen tanks should be placed between the patients legs and the monitor 
should be secured on the oxygen cylinder to prevent injury to the patient. Pumps should be 
secured to the litter 
 Better: Additional litter straps to secure equipment and extend the litter with back support as 
indicated for vented patients to prevent VAP. 
 Best: Above and use the SMEED to keep the monitor and other transport equipment off patient 
*if possible, identify with tape the location of interventions or access points on top of hypothermia 
management to allow transport teams quick identification of location. 
Prepare Dressings 
Air Evacuation and other MEDEVAC assets do not routinely change dressings during transport; 
therefore, ensure all dressings are changed, labeled, and secured before patient pick up 
 Good: Secure and reinforce dressings with tape, date, and time all dressings. 
 Better: Change dressings within 24 hours of departure, secure as above. 
 Best: Change and reinforce dressings within 4 hours of departure. Ensure additional Class VIII is 
available for any unforeseen issues in flight. 
Secure the Patient 
 Good: Litter with minimum of 2 litter straps 
 Better: Litter with padding (example: AE pad or Sleep Mat) with minimum of 3 litter straps 
 Best: Litter with padding and flight approved litter headrest with minimum of 3 litter straps 
(additional litter straps can be used to secure patient or equipment)
