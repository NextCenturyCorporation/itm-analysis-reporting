Tactical Combat Casualty Care
Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC or TC3) are the United
States military guidelines for trauma life support in prehospital
combat medicine, designed to reduce preventable deaths while
maintaining operation success. The TCCC guidelines are routinely
updated and published by the Committee on Tactical Combat
Casualty Care (CoTCCC), which is part of the Defense
Committees on Trauma (DCoT) division of the Defense Health
Agency (DHA).[1] TCCC was designed in the 1990s for the
Special Operations Command medical community. Originally a
joint Naval Special Warfare Command and Special Operations
Medical Research & Development initiative, CoTCCC developed
combat-appropriate and evidence-based trauma care based on
injury patterns of previous conflicts. The original TCCC corpus
was published in a Military Medicine supplement in 1996.[2]
TCCC has since become a Department of Defense (DoD) course,
conducted by National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians.[3]
The CoTCCC was originally established by the United States Special Operations Command in 2002 before
moving to the Naval Medical Education & Training Command in 2004. The CoTCCC was moved again in
2007 as a standing subcommittee of the Defense Health Board (DHB). In 2012, the CoTCCC was once
again moved to the domain of the JTS. In August 2018, the JTS along with CoTCCC were realigned as a
directorate of the DHA. The CoTCCC now operates as a component of the DCoT. The CoTCCC has 42
voting members, who are specialized physicians, providers, and enlisted medical specialties from the
United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.[4] The TCCC Working Group is
larger group operating in conjunction with the CoTCCC consisting of non-voting members from
throughout the DoD, US government agencies, civilian medical professionals, and partner nations.[5]
The TCCC guidelines are a set of evidence-based best practice guidelines for battlefield trauma care that
have been developed over more than 18 years of war. Oversight of the TCCC guidelines is provided by the
CoTCCC, which continually update them. Current guidelines are available online through the Deployed
Medicine site, or through the Joint Trauma System site. They are also reproduced by the National
Association of Emergency Medical Technicians websites, the Journal of Special Operations Medicine, and
the Special Operations Medical Association.
The three objectives of TCCC are to provide lifesaving care to the injured combatant, to limit the risk of
further casualties, and to help the unit achieve mission success.

In TCCC prehospital battlefield care is divided into 3 phases:
CUF is characterized as the care rendered to a casualty while still
under effective fire. In this case, the first action is to return fire and
take cover, and should include the casualty remaining engaged if
able. As an enemy is suppressed, casualties can move or be moved
to more secure positions. The only medical treatment rendered in
CUF is stopping life-threatening hemorrhaging (bleeding). TCCC
actively endorses and recommends the early and immediate use of
tourniquets to control massive external hemorrhaging of limbs. All
other treatment should be delayed until the casualty can be moved
to a more secure and covered position and transitioned to tactical
field care.[2]
TFC is care rendered by first responders or prehospital medical
personnel (primarily medics, corpsman, and pararescuemen) while
still in the tactical environment.[2] TFC is focused on assessment
and management using the MARCH acronym.
Massive hemorrhage is managed through the use of
tourniquets, hemostatic dressings, junctional devices,
and pressure dressings.
The Airway is managed by rapid and aggressive
opening of the airway to include cricothyroidotomy for
difficult airways.
Respirations and breathing is managed by the
assessment for tension pneumothorax and aggressive
use of needle decompression devices to relieve tension
and improve breathing.
Circulation impairment is assessed and managed
through the initiation of intravenous access followed up
by administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) if indicated, and a fluid resuscitation challenge
using the principles of hypotensive resuscitation. TCCC promotes the early and far forward
use of blood and blood products if available over the use colloids and discourages the
administration of crystalloids such as normal saline (sodium chloride).
Hypothermia prevention is an early and critical intervention to keep a traumatized casualty
warm regardless of the operational environment.
Phases of care
Care Under Fire (CUF)
Tactical Field Care (TFC)
Continued assessment and management in TFC includes treating penetrating eye trauma, assessing for
traumatic brain injury or head injuries, treating burns, splinting fractures, and dressing non-life-threatening
wounds. TCCC promotes the early and aggressive use of analgesia (pain management) on the battlefield
through the administration of Ketamine and/or Oral Tranmuccossal Fentanyl for casualties with moderate to
severe pain. TCCC also promotes the early administration of oral and intravenous or intramuscular
antibiotics. The remainder of TFC is dedicated is reassessment of injuries and interventions, documentation
of care, communicating with tactical leadership and evacuation assets. TFC culminates with packaging a
casualty for evacuation and then evacuating by available air, ground, or maritime assets.
TACEVAC care encompasses the same assessment and management included in TFC with additional
focus on advanced procedures that can be initiated when en route to a medical treatment facility. The caveat
of TACEVAC is the evacuation means and care may or may not be dedicated medical platforms such as a
MEDEVAC helicopter. TACEVAC can also include the evacuation of casualties on available non-medical
assets and the provision of care in such circumstances, which is also referred to as CASEVAC or casualty
evacuation. This is typically a non-medically designated vehicle.[2]
A significant amount of medical literature attests that TCCC is the most viable and reliable methodology to
prepare for and manage casualties on the modern battlefield. Most battlefield casualties died of their injuries
before ever reaching a surgeon. As most pre-medical treatment facility (pre-MTF) deaths are nonsurvivable,
mitigation strategies to impact outcomes in this population need to be directed toward injury prevention. To
significantly impact the outcome of combat casualties with potentially survivable (PS) injury, strategies
must be developed to mitigate hemorrhage and optimize airway management or reduce the time interval
between the battlefield point of injury and surgical intervention.[6] A command-directed casualty response
system that trains ALL personnel in Tactical Combat Casualty Care resulted in unprecedented reduction of
killed-in-action deaths, casualties who died of wounds, and preventable combat death.[7] There are key
components of a prehospital casualty response system, emphasize the importance of leadership, underscore
the synergy achieved through collaboration between medical and nonmedical leaders, and provide an
example to other organizations and communities striving to achieve success in trauma as measured through
improved casualty survival.[8] The success of the medical improvements during the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan have served to maintain the lowest case fatality rate on record.[9]
