TACTICAL COMBAT CASUALTY CARE
(TCCC / TC3)
FORWARD
Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) has saved hundreds of lives during our nation's conflicts in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. Nearly 90% of combat fatalities occur before the casualty reaches a Medical treatment facility, it 
is clear that the prehospital phase of care is the focus of efforts to reduce deaths in combat. Very few military 
physicians, however, have had training in this area. As a result, at the onset of hostilities, most combat 
Medics, corpsmen, and para-rescue personnel (PJs) in the US Military were trained to perform battlefield 
trauma care through the use of civilian-based trauma courses that were not designed for the prehospital 
combat environment and did not reflect contemporary knowledge in this area. 
This challenge was met by the Committee on TCCC (CoTCCC) voting members and its many liaison members 
that collectively comprise the TCCC Working Group. This remarkably eclectic group includes trauma surgeons, 
emergency medicine physicians, internists, family medicine physicians, operational physicians and physician 
assistants, combat medical educators, trauma researchers, pathologists, combat medical doctrine developers, 
medical equipment specialists, and combat medics, corpsmen, and PJs. All of the US Armed Services are wellrepresented in the group's membership and 100% of the CoTCCC voting members have been to war. The 
CoTCCC and the TCCC Working Group represents different services, disciplines, and military experiences, all 
brought to bear on a single goal - reducing preventable deaths on the battlefield. 
No such group existed when the Twin Towers fell. The US Special Operations Command initially funded the 
group as a research effort, then ownership of the group was successively assumed by the Naval Operational 
Medicine Institute, the Defense Health Board, and now the Joint Trau-ma System. 
This group has taken the TCCC Guidelines as they existed in 2001 and continually updated them throughout 
the 15 years of war, based on input from the Joint Trauma System Performance Improvement trauma 
teleconferences, published case reports and case series from the war zones, breakthroughs in military Medical 
research, and new publications from the civilian medical literature that bear on combat trauma. It has 
processed a continual steam of input from the battlefield throughout the war years and ensured that 
battlefield trauma care lessons learned were not just noted, but acted upon. 
Through the ongoing volunteer efforts of this dedicated group of individuals - which met quarterly throughout 
most of the war - US Forces have had prehospital trauma care guidelines that were customized for the 
battlefield and updated continuously based on real-time evaluation of outcomes from ongoing combat 
operations. This is the first time in our nation's history that this has occurred. 
The success of TCCC effort had been well documented. It is a great tribute to all of the members of the CoTCCC 
and the TCCC Working Group, that it has been able to transcend service and Medical specialty differences, 
process new information expertly, and develop evidence-based, best-practice guidelines that have completely 
transformed battlefield trauma care.. 
It is to the Committee on TCCC and all of our valued colleagues in the TCCC Working Group that this TCCC text 
is dedicated. Our country and its casualties owe you all a profound measure of thanks.

(TCCC / TC3)
ABBREVIATED TCCC GUIDELINES
31 JAN 2017
Return Fire and take cover
Direct or expect casualty to remain engaged as a combatant if appropriate
Direct casualty to move to cover and apply self-aid if able.
Try to keep the casualty from sustaining additional wounds.
Stop life-threatening external hemorrhage if tactically feasible:
- Direct casualty to control hemorrhage by self-aid if able.
Use a CoTCCC-recommended limb tourniquet for extremity hemorrhage 
- Move the casualty to cover
Airway management is generally best deferred until the Tactical Field Care phase.
Basic Management Plan for Care Under Fire
Basic Management Plan for Tactical Field Care
Establish Security Perimeter IAW Tactical SOPs. Maintain situational awareness.
Triage Casualties as required. Altered mental status is criteria to have weapons cleared/secured, communications gear 
secured and sensitive items redistributed.
Massive Hemorrhage
Assess for unrecognized hemorrhage and control all life-threatening bleeding. 
Use one or more CoTCCC-recommended limb tourniquets if necessary.
Use a CoTCCC approved hemostatic dressing for compressible hemorrhage not amenable to limb tourniquet 
use. 
Immediately apply a CoTCCC-recommended junctional tourniquet if the bleeding site is amenable to use of a 
junctional tourniquet. 
Airway Management
Unconscious casualty without airway obstruction:
-Chin lift or jaw thrust maneuver
-Nasopharyngeal airway
-Place the casualty in the recovery position
Casualty with airway obstruction or impending airway obstruction:
-Allow a conscious casualty to assume any position that best protects the airway, to include sitting up
-Chin lift or jaw thrust maneuver
-Nasopharyngeal airway
-Place an unconscious casualty in the recovery position
If the previous measures are unsuccessful perform a surgical cricothyroidotomy using one of the following:
-CricKey technique 
-Bougie-aided open surgical technique 
-Standard open surgical technique 
*Use lidocaine if the casualty is conscious

Basic Management Plan for Tactical Field Care continued
Circulation - IV/IO Access
Start an 18-gauge IV or Saline Lock if indicated. 
If IV access is not obtainable, use an intraosseous (IO) needle.
Circulation - Bleeding
Apply a pelvic binder for suspected pelvic fracture and/or severe blunt force or blast injury. 
Reassess prior tourniquet application: 
-Expose the wound and determine if a tourniquet is needed; if bleeding is not controlled then tighten 
tourniquet if possible.
-If the first tourniquet does not control bleeding after tightening, then add a second tourniquet side-byside with the first.
Convert Limb tourniquets and junctional tourniquets if the following three criteria are met: 
-The casualty is not in shock. 
-It is possible to monitor the wound closely for bleeding. 
-The tourniquet is not being used to control bleeding from an amputation.
Convert tourniquets in less than 2 hours if bleeding can be controlled with other means.
 Expose and use an indelible marker to clearly mark all tourniquet sites with the time of tourniquet application, 
 reapplication, conversion, or removal.
Respiration/Breathing
In a casualty with progressive respiratory distress and known or suspected torso trauma, consider a tension 
pneumothorax: 
-Decompress the chest on the side of the injury at the primary or alternate site.
All open and/or sucking chest wounds should be treated by:
-Applying a vented chest seal (preferred)
-Applying a non-vented chest seal 
-Burp the wound if indicated for breathing difficulty
Initiate pulsoximetry monitoring.
Monitor for tension pneumothorax.
Casualties with moderate/severe TBI should be given supplemental oxygen when available to maintain an 
oxygen saturation > 90%.
Circulation - TXA
If a casualty is anticipated to need a blood transfusion, then administer 1 gram of tranexamic acid (TXA) in 
100ml of NS or LR over 10min ASAP but NOT beyond 3 hours post injury.
Circulation - Fluid Resuscitation
Assess for hemorrhagic shock:
-If not in shock PO fluids are permissible if casualty is conscious and can swallow.
-If in shock resuscitate with:
Whole blood (preferred) or
Plasma, RBCs and platelets (1:1:1) or
Plasma and RBCs (1:1) or
Plasma or if blood products not available,
Hextend or Lactated Ringers or Plasma-Lyte-A
Resuscitate with above fluids until a palpable radial pulse, improved mental status or 
 systolic BP of 80-90 mmHg is present. Discontinue fluids when one or more end points are achieved.
 Reassess casualty frequently to check for recurrence of shock. If shock recurs, verify all hemorrhage is under
 control and repeat fluid resuscitation as above.

Basic Management Plan for Tactical Field Care continued
Penetrating Eye Trauma - If penetrating eye injury is noted or suspected:
Perform a rapid field test of visual acuity and document findings.
Cover eye with a rigid eye shield (not a pressure patch).
 Administer Combat Wound Medication Pack if possible and/or administer IV/IM antibiotics per below.
Burns
Facial burns should be aggressively monitored for airway status and potential inhalation injury.
Estimate total body surface area (TBSA) burned to nearest 10%.
Cover burned areas with dry, sterile dressings. For burns >20% TBSA, consider placing casualty immediately in 
HPMK or other hypothermia prevention means.
Fluid Resuscitation (USAISR Rule of Ten):
-If burns >20% TBSA, initiate IV/IO fluids ASAP with Lactated Ringers, NS, or Hextend. If Hextend, then no 
more than 1000ml followed by LR or NS as needed.
-Initial IV/IO fluid rate = %TBSA X 10ml/per hour for adults 40-80 kg (+100ml/hr for every 10kg above 80kg).
-If hemorrhagic shock is present then resuscitate IAW fluid resuscitation in Circulation section.
All TCCC interventions may be performed on or through burned skin.
Hypothermia Prevention
Minimize casualty environmental exposure and promote heat retention.
Keep personal protective gear on if feasible. Replace wet clothing if possible. Get casualty onto insulated 
 surface ASAP.
Use a hypothermia prevention kit with active rewarming.
If none above is available, then use dry blankets, poncho liners, or sleeping bags and keep the casualty warm 
 and dry.
Warm IV fluids are preferred.
Monitoring – Initiate advanced electronic monitoring of vital signs if available.
Analgesia/Pain Management
Analgesia on the battlefield should generally be achieved by one of three options:
Mild to Moderate Pain and/or Casualty can swallow and is still able to fight:
-Administer TCCC Combat Wound Medication Pack (CWMP)
Moderate to Severe Pain and casualty IS NOT in Shock
-Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate (OTFC) 800mcg
Moderate to Severe Pain and casualty is in hemorrhagic shock or respiratory distress
-Administer Ketamine 50mg IM or IN repeating q30min prn
OR
-Administer Ketamine 20mg Slow IV or IO repeating q20min prn
*Endpoint control of pain or development of nystagmus.
*Consider Ondansetron 4mg ODT/IV/IO/IM q8hours prn for nausea and vomiting.
Antibiotics
If able to take PO, then administer Moxifloxacin 400mg PO qDaily from CWPP.
If unable to take PO, administer Ertapenem 1 gram IV/IM qDaily.
Wounds
Inspect and dress known wounds.
Check for Additional Wounds.

TACTICAL COMBAT CASUALTY CARE
(TCCC / TC3)
TRIAGE CATEGORIES
This category includes those casualties who require an immediate LSI and/or surgery. Put simply, if medical attention is not provided they will die. 
The key to successful triage is to locate these individuals as quickly as possible. Casualties do not remain in this category for an extended 
period of time. They are either found, triaged and treated, or they die! Hemodynamically unstable casualties with airway obstruction, chest or 
abdominal injuries, massive external bleeding, or shock deserve this classification.
IMMEDIATE
This category includes those wounded who are likely to need surgery, but whose general condition permits delay in surgical treatment without 
unduly endangering the life, limb, or eyesight of the casualty. Sustaining treatment will be required (e.g., oral or IV fluids, splinting, 
administration of antibiotics and pain control), but can possibly wait. Examples of casualties in this category include those with no evidence of 
shock who have; large soft tissue wounds, fractures of major bones, intra-abdominal and/or thoracic wounds, and burns to less than 20% of total 
body surface area (TBSA).
DELAYED
Casualties in this category are often referred as the “walking wounded.” Although these patients may appear to be in bad shape at first, it is their 
physiologic state that tells the true story. These casualties have minor injuries (e.g., small burns, lacerations, abrasions, or small fractures) that 
can usually be treated with self- or buddy-aid. These casualties should be utilized for mission requirements (e.g., scene security), to help treat 
and/or transport the more seriously wounded, or put back into the fight.
MINIMAL
Casualties in this category have wounds that are so extensive, that even if they were the sole casualty and had the benefit of optimal 
medical resources, their survival would be highly unlikely. Even so, expectant casualties should not be neglected. They should receive 
comfort measures and pain medication if possible, and they deserve re-triage as appropriate. Examples of expectant casualties are the 
unresponsive with injuries such as penetrating head trauma with obvious massive damage to the brain.

or
www.usaisr.amedd.army.mil/pdfs/POI_TCCC_AAR_26Apr2013.pdf 
or

The TCCC AAR is to be completed within 72 hours of the injury 
occurring, by the POI Medical team or Role I, and sent to the DoD 
Trauma Registry (DoDTR).
E-mail To:
usarmy.jbsa.medcom-aisr.list.jts-trauma-registry@mail.mil. 
The DoDTR is the data repository for DoD trauma-related injuries. The goal of this registry is to document, in 
electronic format, information about the demographics, injury-producing incident, diagnosis and treatment, and 
outcome of injuries sustained by US/Non-US military and US/ Non-US civilian personnel in wartime and peacetime 
from the point of wounding to final disposition. The JTS collects data from TCCC cards (DD Form 1380, TCCC AARs 
and from the Armed Forces Medical Examiner Services (AFMES). Documentation is vital to accumulate data in the 
DoD Trauma registry, formerly the Joint Theater Trauma Registry (JTTR). The JTS functions as:
 
1. JTS Operations consisting of; Data Acquisition mines Medical records to abstract, code, and enter critical 
trauma data into the DoDTR database. Data Analysis develops, queries, and provides data from the DoDTR in 
response to requests for information and conducts classified and non-classified data analysis. Data Automation 
supports the information technology for the DoDTR and data-related special projects. 
2. Trauma Care Delivery maintains a database of operational and physiologic parameters related to 
delivery of en route care and has evaluated the validity of the "Golden Hour" standard for movement of casualties 
from point of injury to the first surgical capability. The addition of a military en route care registry (MERCuRY) will 
capture all ground, air and ship transport care. 
3. Performance Improvement (PI) coordinates improvement activities across the spectrum of trauma care 
developing PI course content and training for combatant command trauma system development.

COMMITTEE ON TACTICAL COMBAT CASUALTY CARE
AND THE JOINT TRAUMA SYSTEM
CoTCCC MISSION:
To develop on an ongoing basis the best possible 
set of trauma care guidelines customized for the 
tactical environment and to facilitate the transition 
of these recommendations into battlefield trauma 
care practice.
The Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (CoTCCC) is the Prehospital arm of the Joint Trauma System for the 
Department of Defense.
The CoTCCC is composed of 42 voting members specially selected as subject-matter experts in trauma, battlefield medicine, 
tactical medicine, prehospital medicine and their experience in the deployed combat environment. 
The TCCC Working Group is composed of the CoTCCC and hundreds of subject-matter experts across many domains and 
liaisons from DoD, Government and Partner nation organizations.
The CoTCCC and the TCCC Working Group focus all of their efforts on providing the best recommendations for training and 
equipment for our individual service members, combat medics, corpsman, pararescue, and med techs going into harm's way 
around the world.
JTS MISSION:
The mission of the Joint Trauma System (JTS) is to provide evidencebased process improvement of trauma and combat casualty care, to 
drive morbidity and mortality to the lowest possible levels, and to 
provide evidence-based recommendations on trauma care and 
trauma systems across the Department of Defense (DoD).
