RULES OF ENGAGEMENT AND RULES FOR THE USE OF FORCE 
DEVELOPMENT 
Rules of engagement (ROE) are rules that govern the use of force to reflect the 
will of the civilian and military leadership. ROE are defined as “directives issued by 
competent military authority that delineate the circumstances and limitations under 
which United States forces will initiate and/or continue combat engagement with other 
forces encountered.”3 ROE constrain the actions of forces to ensure their actions are 
consistent with domestic and international law, national policy, and objectives. ROE are 
based upon domestic and international law, history, strategy, political concerns, and a 
vast wealth of operational wisdom, experience, and knowledge provided by military 
commanders and operators. 
Rules for the use of force (RUF) apply when Department of Defense (DOD) forces 
are performing civil support missions and routine Service functions including 
force protection within the US and its territories or when DOD forces are 
performing law enforcement or security duties within (when permitted by the 
Posse Comitatus Act) or outside the US. 
Appendix F offers considerations to assist the commander with ROE development. 
PURPOSES 
ROE and RUF ensure that any use of force is consistent with national security and 
policy objectives. Used chiefly to regulate the use of force, ROE and RUF either allow or 
limit the ability and means to employ force. ROE serve political, military, and legal 
purposes and define the parameters within which Air Force personnel accomplish their 
missions. They ensure national policy and objectives are reflected in the actions of Air 
Force forces and set constraints on a commander's actions so they are consistent with 
domestic and international law and national policy. ROE help ensure the appropriate 
military capability is applied prudently and often reflect collateral limitations that restrict 
the use of force far beyond what is required by the law of war. History has demonstrated

that, to be most effective, ROE and RUF should represent a confluence of legal 
considerations, national policy objectives, and operational concerns. When the 
actions of military personnel and units are framed by the disciplined application of force 
through effective ROE, commanders can make sound judgments and select the best 
possible course of action to accomplish the mission. 
ROE ensure that Air Force forces comply with the law of war. Air Force forces 
adhere to the law of war and embrace the principles set forth therein, including the 
principles of military necessity, humanity, proportionality, and discrimination. ROE are 
an important mechanism to assist commanders in fulfilling their obligations under the 
law of war and are often used to reinforce certain law of war principles. 
PRINCIPLES 
Absent specific operational necessity, ROE and RUF should never impede the 
inherent right of self-defense of US forces. ROE and RUF for US forces should not 
limit a commander's inherent authority and obligation to use all necessary means 
available to take action in self-defense of the commander's unit and other US forces in 
the vicinity. The right and obligation of unit self-defense should never be compromised. 
US forces do not have to be the subject of a hostile act before responding in self- 
defense. US forces may respond in self-defense to demonstrated hostile intent against 
the United States, US forces, or other designated persons or property. Commanders at 
every echelon are responsible for establishing or requesting ROE for mission 
accomplishment that comply with ROE of senior commanders and the US Standing 
ROE. 
By following the ROE and RUF principles outlined below, Air Force forces’ missions are 
less likely to be compromised and US political and military objectives are more likely 
achieved: 
ROE and RUF should complement US interests and military objectives. 
ROE and RUF should not be too specific or restrictive. 
ROE and RUF should be current and responsive to change. 
ROE and RUF should not diminish operational effectiveness. 
ROE and RUF should permit the timely and appropriate use of force. 
CHARACTERISTICS 
Effective ROE and RUF allow commanders to apply the tenets of airpower to support 
national security objectives without constraining capabilities of forces. To maximize 
operational effectiveness, ROE should: 
27 
Be transparent and clearly linked to mission accomplishment. 
Be continually briefed to all Airmen by commanders, warfighters, and judge 
advocates. 
Be tailored to the audience and easy to understand, remember, and apply. 
Be constantly reviewed for modification or amplification. 
Be simple, clear, brief, and seamless. 
Avoid excessively qualified language. 
Avoid mention of strategy or doctrine. 
Avoid restating the law of war. 
AFJAGC STAFF ROLE IN ROE AND RUF DEVELOPMENT 
Judge advocates serve as the principal advisor to the commander, Air Force forces and 
staff, as well as to the joint force air component commander (when the COMAFFOR is 
so appointed) for ROE and RUF. A judge advocate assists in the development of ROE 
and RUF, but the operators (planning and executing in the operational chain of 
command) have the responsibility to formulate and submit ROE and RUF for approval. 
Modifying ROE and RUF 
Judge advocates and paralegals assist commanders in modifying or requesting 
changes to the ROE and RUF. With few exceptions, ROE are fundamentally permissive 
in nature and allow commanders to modify or request changes to them to support 
mission accomplishment. Unlike the permissive nature of ROE, special weapons and 
tactics not authorized within RUF are not approved. At various levels in the operational 
chain of command, ROE supplemental measures may be approved to allow or limit the 
use of force for mission accomplishment or for self-defense. Judge advocates and 
paralegals assist commanders in determining appropriate ROE and RUF and 
recommend changes when necessary. Commanders should seek modification to ROE 
and RUF through the chain of command. Modification and clarification may be 
warranted when the ROE or RUF are inadequate, faulty, create the risk of friendly fire 
incident, or hinder a commander's ability to carry out the mission. 
Implementing ROE and RUF 
Air Force commanders expect judge advocates to know and fully advise Air Force 
forces on ROE and RUF.
