INTRODUCTION
FHP requires continuous vigilance. History shows 
that deaths due to nonbattle injury and illness can be 
more numerous and more impactful than those due 
to combat. Figure 16-1 illustrates the historical fluctuations in the ratio of deaths due to nonbattle injury 
and illness compared to deaths due to combat across 
major US conflicts. 2 Many factors contribute to the 
fluctuations in this ratio, including knowledge of the 
health threats present in new theaters of operation and 
the knowledge and ability to develop effective countermeasures. The rise in deaths due to illness in the 
Spanish-American War inspired research into yellow 
fever, which produced critical knowledge about mosquito vectors and effective vector control programs. 3
Illness and death that occur many years after a conflict may not be reported or associated with exposures 
that occurred during combat. This was the case with 
many veterans following the Vietnam War. Vietnam 
veterans’ illnesses, and their possible association with 
the herbicides used during the conflict, led to Public 
Law 102-4, the Agent Orange Act of 1991, nearly 20 
years after the end of the conflict. 4 The Agent Orange 
Act then spurred 2 decades of epidemiological and 
toxicological study; however, much of the findings are 
still inconclusive. 4 A moderate increase in the ratio of 
death due to nonbattle injury and illness was also seen 
after the Persian Gulf War. These deaths were largely 
due to training and motor vehicle accidents, but the 
History of Force Health Protection
Force health protection (FHP) is simply the prevention of disease and injury in order to protect the 
strength and capabilities of the military population. 
This concept was most eloquently stated in 1866 by 
Dr Jonathan Letterman, medical director of the Army 
of the Potomac, when he wrote, “A corps of medical 
officers was not established solely for the purpose of 
attending the wounded and sick . . . . The leading idea 
is to strengthen the hands of the Commanding General by keeping his army in the most vigorous health, 
thus rendering it, in the highest degree, efficient for 
enduring fatigue and privation, and for fighting.”1(p23) 
In fact, the military’s focus on preventive medicine 
can be traced to the earliest days of the republic, when 
General George Washington ordered the inoculation of 
the Continental Army against smallpox, following the 
recommendations of his physician in chief, and issued 
“Instructions for Soldiers in the Service of the United 
States Concerning the Means of Preserving Health: 
Of Cleanliness.” These measures helped preserve 
the army’s fighting strength and contributed to the 
ultimate victory over the British forces. In addition, 
General Washington’s policies on preserving health, 
in concert with those of Baron Von Steuben, the army’s 
first inspector general, laid the foundations for modern 
military preventive medicine. 1

Health Services Support3
Details FHP requirements and activities as an equal part of health services support to joint operations and defines roles 
and responsibilities of the joint force surgeon and the FHP staff
The FHP division’s primary function is to assist the joint force surgeon with establishing policies and procedures to 
deliver a healthy and fit force, prevent casualties, and maintain the health of the joint force while deployed. This will be 
similar to what is expected for the COCOM (see COCOM operations plan requirements) but may be tailored to the specific mission of the joint task force and the joint operations area (JOA)
Provides details into the components of the FHP strategy for the JOA:
Casualty Prevention
 
• All measures taken by commanders, leaders, individuals, and healthcare system to promote, improve, or conserve 
the mental and physical well-being of military personnel 
Preventive Medicine (PRVTMED)
 
• Overall anticipation, prevention, and control of communicable diseases, illnesses, injuries, and exposures to endemic, 
occupational, and environmental threats
Health Surveillance
 
• The iterative process of identifying the population at risk, identifying and assessing potential exposures, communicating these risks, developing and employing countermeasures and monitoring and reporting of DNBI/BI rates
Combat and Operational Stress Control 
 
• Programs and actions to prevent, identify, and manage adverse combat and operational stress reactions in units
Preventive Dentistry
 
• Primary, secondary, and tertiary measures to reduce or eliminate dental conditions that interfere with fitness for 
duty

illnesses following this war, reminiscent of Vietnam 
veterans’ illnesses and the associated challenges in 
determining exposures and associations, were the 
impetus behind current FHP strategy, policies, and 
programs. 5 
Concept and Strategy
The new FHP concept that evolved in the decade 
after the Persian Gulf War is a unified strategy encompassing all preventive, clinical, and operational 
programs needed to maximize the health of the 
military population. It covers the entire career of 
the service member, in addition to the specific times 
before, during, and after deployment. FHP includes 
robust combat casualty care and plays a significant 
role in medical readiness planning and training. The 
strategy incorporates improved health risk communication, health surveillance, longitudinal health records, biomedical research on countermeasures, and 
interagency coordination based on lessons learned 
and recommendations from the Institute of Medicine. 5 The FHP strategy is codified in Department 
of Defense (DoD) Directive 6490. 02E, Comprehensive 
Health Surveillance6; DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6490. 03, 
Deployment Health7; and Joint Publication (JP) 4-02, 
Health Service Support. 8 The renewed focus on FHP 
led to the addition of a dedicated chapter in the 
most current version of JP 4-02. Key components 
of these documents are summarized in Table 16-1. 
Implementation of these directives is described in 
service-specific guidance. 
DEPLOYMENT HEALTH ACTIVITIES
Predeployment
Although DoDI 6490. 03 describes specific health 
activities that must occur in the time immediately 
preceding deployment, predeployment health activities actually begin at the outset of each service member’s career. At the most fundamental level, accession 
physical examinations begin the process of screening 
out individuals with medical conditions that preclude 
them from military service. The medical standards of 
each of the services are developed with the intent of 
insuring mission success and protecting the health of 
the individual. The basic tenet of medicine, “primum 
non nocere” (first, do no harm) applies to the decision 
to “medically clear” an individual to participate in the 
physically and mentally demanding environment of 
military training, deployment, and combat. Accession 
medical standards are found in DoDI 6130. 039 and 
are implemented by each of the services in separate 
instructions. 
Following accession, annual health evaluations 
occur throughout a service member’s military career. These annual health evaluations, known as the 
Periodic Health Assessment, provide an opportunity 
for the medical officer to both screen for disease and 
assess fitness and performance. At each evaluation, 
the service member should be screened for conditions 
that are not compatible with retention in the military 
in accordance with DoDI 6490. 07. 10 In general, the 
medical officer should consider whether the person 
will be able to carry out duties both in garrison and 
during deployment, and how any medical condition 
may be affected by factors such as climate, altitude, 
rations, housing, duty assignment, and medical 
services available in theater. More specifically, the 
medical officer should evaluate whether the person 
can wear all personal protective equipment, including 
helmet, body armor, and chemical protective wear, 
when needed. In addition, the service member should 
be screened for completion of individual medical 
readiness requirements that include immunizations, 
dental examinations, medical equipment such as corrective lenses and gas mask inserts, and laboratory 
tests such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
or tuberculosis screening. 
When a service member is identified for deployment, a specific Pre-Deployment Health Assessment 
must be completed and documented on DD Form 
2795. This assessment is a more focused medical 
evaluation based on the details of the deployed mission and location. Specific medical requirements stem 
from the health risk assessment and occupational and 
environmental health (OEH) site assessments (see Developing a Deployment Health Surveillance Program, 
below) done by the combatant command (COCOM) 
or joint task force (JTF). These medical requirements 
are published in a health services support annex of 
the operations plan. Individual medical requirements 
include preventive countermeasures such as immunizations, prophylactic medicines, personal protective equipment, predeployment biomonitoring, DoD 
serum repository laboratory tests, and prescription 
medications as needed. 
Predeployment health activities are not just focused 
on the individual, but also encompass medical planning at the COCOM, JTF, and unit level. As mentioned 
above, the COCOM or JTF must complete health risk 
assessments and OEH site assessments, and plan for 
medical resources required to accomplish the FHP 
mission. There must be a plan for health surveillance 
238
Fundamentals of Military Medicine
through all phases of deployment from the COCOM or 
JTF level down to the unit medical officer. Finally, health 
risks must be communicated to the commander and 
to individual members to ensure all health threats are 
understood and preventive countermeasures followed.
Deployment
The preventive medicine team should be in theater 
as early as possible to validate the health risk assessment, mitigate unidentified threats, conduct additional 
OEH site assessments, and enforce proper base camp 
set-up. To accomplish these measures, the preventive 
medicine team should be included with the advance 
team whenever possible. Health surveillance in theater 
must be carried out from day 1, with daily recording 
and reporting of disease and injury cases as directed 
by the JTF or COCOM surgeon. If a formal reporting 
structure has not been developed, the unit medical 
officer should take the initiative to record disease and 
injury cases for the unit. All patient encounters must 
be documented and incorporated into the patient’s 
deployment health record. 
Throughout the deployment, continuous inspection 
for compliance with preventive countermeasures and 
investigation of disease outbreaks must be done. Disease 
outbreaks should be recognized early and investigations conducted, recorded, and communicated. In addition, any occupational; environmental; or chemical, 
biological, or radiological exposure incidents should 
also be investigated, recorded, and documented in the 
individual’s deployment health record. Also, food and 
water inspections should be conducted regularly. If 
water safety depends on chlorination, daily chlorination checks are critical. Fecal contamination of drinking 
water will result in rapid and widespread cases of diarrheal illness with potential for adverse mission impact. 
Inspection of food and water sources is an FHP activity 
conducted by the US Army Veterinary Corps as well 
as US Air Force public health officers to ensure food 
wholesomeness, safety, quality assurance, and defense. 
The revised FHP strategy that followed the Persian 
Gulf War increased efforts to associate deployment 
exposures with disease outcomes. The focus on OEH 
site assessments, exposure incident investigations, 
and documentation is a result of these revisions. AdDeployment Health Activities

ditionally, the location of deployed personnel must 
be recorded once daily and electronically reported 
to the Defense Manpower Data Center. Exposure 
assessments are recorded in the Military Exposure 
Surveillance Library (MESL). The MESL and health 
surveillance data are reported to and managed by the 
Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch, Office of the 
Assistant Secretary of Defense, Health Affairs.
Postdeployment
Postdeployment health activities start with a health 
threat debrief and comprehensive health risk communication to ensure individual service members and the 
command are informed of the health threats they may 
have been exposed to. The postdeployment period is 
a prime opportunity for education about any real or 
perceived exposures that may have occurred and the 
need for completion of any postexposure prophylactic medications. Medical personnel should focus on 
continued surveillance of the redeployed population 
and must be educated about all possible health threats 
encountered in the deployment. 
Service members must complete all mandatory 
postdeployment health assessments in the prescribed 
time period, and medical personnel should have surveillance processes in place to track compliance with 
this requirement. A redeployed member who has not 
completed these assessments or face-to-face encounters remains an unknown risk. Commanders should 
be briefed on the postdeployment health assessment 
completion rates with the same level of importance 
as predeployment assessments. Command support 
may be necessary to achieve 100% completion of these 
assessments. 
Postdeployment health activities also focus on documentation of exposures that occurred during deployment. The Post-Deployment Health Assessment asks 
service members to report any known or perceived 
exposures. The medical officer must then evaluate 
each one for validity and estimation of the individual 
health risk. Better resources now exist to match these 
self-reports with known exposure sampling. Despite 
the efforts of the Defense Manpower Data Center and 
the MESL, matching area sample exposure data to individual disease risk and outcome remains challenging. 
For this reason, it is important that service members 
who report concerns about deployment exposures 
receive a referral to appropriately trained healthcare 
providers such as OEH experts who can counsel them 
about health risks. 11 Deployment health activities are 
summarized in Figure 16-2 and Table 16-1. 
DEVELOPING A DEPLOYMENT HEALTH SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM
Health surveillance refers to the systematic collection, 
analysis, and interpretation of health-related data. It involves an iterative process of planning, acting, collecting, 
and reflecting with the goal of achieving a better outcome 
for the mission and the deployed population. Developing a health surveillance program includes identifying 
the population at risk, conducting a health risk assessment, developing and instituting countermeasures to 
prevent or reduce the health threat, monitoring and 
reporting disease and injury rates, health risk communication, and command support. A health surveillance 
program can be instituted for any population at risk, 
deployed or in garrison, unit-specific or DoD-wide. For 
the purposes of this chapter, components of a health 
surveillance program for a deploying population will 
be described. Properly executed, a health surveillance 
program enables the timely recognition of health risks, 
leading to interventions that prevent, treat, reduce, or 
control disease and injury. 
Step 1. Identify the Population at Risk 
The first critical step in deployment health surveillance is to identify the population at risk. The medical officer should be invited into the mission analysis 
and planning process as early as possible to facilitate 
this critical first step. The population at risk are those 
personnel who will be involved in the mission and 
functioning within the theater of operations or the 
joint operations area. They are the people who must 
undergo predeployment screening, monitoring for 
disease and injury during deployment, and postdeployment follow-up. Key questions to ask are “who 
is going?” and “how many?” 
Answering the “who?” question should take into 
account both group and individual factors. 
The group includes the units being tasked for a 
mission, which is found in the operations plan and 
deployment order. Each group will have specific 
mission tasks and include occupational subgroups, 
which will drive additional health risk assessments. 
Individual factors focus on age, preexisting health 
conditions, and predisposition for contracting disease 
or being injured. For example, risk for cardiovascular 
events is higher in older individuals, especially if 
they are traveling into areas with poor air quality. 
The medical officer will need to take these factors 
into account during the predeployment health assessment and provide proper health risk counseling 
to individuals and the group. 
240
Fundamentals of Military Medicine
Determining how many personnel will be in the 
mission is needed for the risk estimate. The risk 
estimate is the percentage of personnel who will be 
affected by a particular health threat. A small group 
performing a critical mission may need to be more 
risk adverse for disease and injury because loss of 
even one member could impact mission accomplishment. Therefore, unit members might need to be 
highly disciplined about food and water sources and 
carry antibiotic treatment to avoid disabling diarrhea, 
or the unit may be ordered to avoid high-risk sports 
activities to prevent injury. A larger unit with some 
redundancy may not require preventive measures as 
strict or encompassing, and they should be balanced 
with the needs of unit morale. It is the duty of the 
medical officer to advise the unit commander on the 
risk estimate of each health threat and the feasibility 
of each preventive countermeasure. 
Step 2. Conduct a Health Risk Assessment 
A comprehensive health risk assessment is used to 
anticipate, recognize, and evaluate both noncombat 
and combat-related threats to the health of the force 
so that effective countermeasures can be developed 
and implemented. The health risk assessment starts 
in the predeployment period, is continuously reevaluated during deployment, and extends into the 
postdeployment surveillance period. A health threat 
can be defined as the composite of all potential actions, 
conditions, infections, or events that could degrade 
the performance or mission capability of a person or 
a unit. Army Techniques Publication 4-02 specifically 
defines the term health threat as “a composite of all 
ongoing potential enemy actions and environmental 
conditions (disease and non-battle injuries [DNBIs]) 
that may render a soldier combat ineffective.”12(p2-1) 
The enemy threat must be assessed for the potential to 
produce combat-related injury or illness from conventional, improvised, chemical, biological, or radiological 
weapons. A health threat is assessed for the potential 
impact on the unit as a whole. 
Multiple factors, assumptions, and background elements must be considered by the medical officer when 
building the health risk assessment. The ongoing and 
systematic collection and analysis of this information 
is known as the medical intelligence preparation of 
the operational environment (MIPOE). 8 The MIPOE is 
the framework on which the health risk assessment is 
built. Table 16-2 summarizes factors to be considered 
in building the MIPOE and health risk assessment. 
What resources are available for building the MIPOE and health risk assessment? The first resource 
should be the office of the command surgeon with 
geographic responsibility for the area into which the 
JTF or unit is being deployed. The combatant command preventive medicine staff should have an initial 
health risk assessment for the region and may have 
a published operations plan with a health services 
support annex. Other COCOM or JTF resources may 
include published medical reporting requirements and 
theater treatment protocols, depending on the maturity 
of the theater. Nonmedical JTF staff are also valuable 
sources of information for the medical officer, as shown 
in Exhibit 16-1. If, however, the medical officer is on 
the command or JTF surgeon’s preventive medicine

information is the DoD’s National Center for Medical 
Intelligence (NCMI). 13 
The NCMI is a closed source of information (requiring DoD credentials to access the website and 
intelligence products). NCMI is specifically tasked 
in DoDI 6490. 03 to provide a broad range of medical 
intelligence. Medical intelligence refers to information 
about foreign military and civilian medical capabilities, 
disease, environmental and industrial health threats, 
and biotechnology that can have an impact on military 
strategy, plans, and operations. 8 Products available to 
the medical officer include the Infectious Disease Risk 
Assessment, Infectious Disease Alert, Health Service 
Assessment, Industrial Facility Health Risk Assessment, and Environmental Health Risk Assessment. 13 
Additional DoD sources of health threat information 
include the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch 
and the MESL; the Armed Services Pest Management 
Board; the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine; the US Army Public Health Center; the 
US Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine; and the 
Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center. Lastly, 
the medical officer should obtain background information and important assumptions directly from the JTF 
or COCOM staff, as summarized in Exhibit 16-2. 
Open sources of health threat information are also 
widely available. The US Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention has a well-developed and easily acEXHIBIT 16-1

be considered by the medical officer. Assessments of 
combat injury and illness threats should consider the 
probability of enemy contact, enemy weapons and 
tactics, and chemical, biological, and radiological 
weapons capability. 
Step 3. Develop Countermeasures
Each health threat should be evaluated for potential countermeasures. The countermeasures should 
be further divided into predeployment, deployment, 
and postdeployment actions (see Exhibit 16-3). 
Figure 16-4 shows countermeasures that could be 
considered within each health threat category. Combat injury countermeasures may include personal 
protective equipment such as body armor, ballistic 
eye protection, laser eye protection, a Kevlar (DuPont, Wilmington, DE) helmet, and mission-oriented 
protective posture gear; prophylactic medications 
in the event of chemical, biological, or radiological 
weapons exposure; and combat stress countermeasures. Combat injury countermeasures may also 
involve strategic-level changes in vehicle design for 
blast protection or changes in tactics such as convoy 
operations. 
Countermeasure effectiveness depends on several 
factors. First, how well does the countermeasure actually 
prevent the health outcome (eg, vaccine effectiveness)? 
Next, how well has the health risk been communicated 
by the medical officer, and how well has inspection and 
surveillance been conducted throughout the deployment cycle? Countermeasure effectiveness also depends 
on individual compliance and the level of command 
support. Finally, changes in the health threat itself 
(eg, virulence) can alter countermeasure effectiveness. 
Step 4. Monitor and Report Disease and Injury
The success of FHP depends on the vigilance of the 
medical officer in monitoring, reporting, and analyzing 
disease and injury rates. Combatant commanders are 
required by DoDI 6490. 03 to “ensure theater health 
surveillance plans and requirements are identified in 
each operation plan,” and to “provide timely reporting 
245
Force Health Protection
of disease and non-battle injuries (DNBI), battle injuries and other medical information.”6(pp7–8) DNBI rates 
should be divided into the most common categories 
such as gastrointestinal, respiratory, dermatologic, 
febrile illness, mental, musculoskeletal, heat or cold 
injury, and dental. More specific categories may be 
developed based on the known health threats in the 
operations area; for example, disease-specific categories like malaria or leishmaniasis or injury-specific 
categories like motor vehicle accidents. In addition, 
reportable medical events should be defined (usually 
by the COCOM) based on the threat to public health 
or the threat to the operational mission. Highly contagious or highly fatal diseases will usually be on this list. 
The medical officer should be aware of the reporting 
requirements and reporting chain in their theater of 
operations. As previously mentioned, medical officers 
must be prepared on the first day in theater to track 
all medical events and patient encounters and, in the 
absence of specific theater guidance, they should develop their own system for surveillance until guidance 
is obtained. 
The goal of disease and injury surveillance is to 
quickly identify new health threats, failure of countermeasures, breakdowns in hygiene or discipline, 
and disease outbreaks, followed by rapid mitigation 
of the threat to protect the health of the force. Surveillance, reporting, and mitigation can result in effective 
changes at the smallest individual unit all the way 
up to COCOM and DoD levels. In one case (author’s 
personal experience), tracking of DNBI resulted in the 
early recognition of increased heat injuries during the 
first days in theater. Because the teams were small and 
rotated every 2 weeks, mission accomplishment was 
adversely affected. Analysis of the events revealed a 
trend in poor physical fitness, with more than half of 
the ill members having failed the service fitness assessment prior to the deployment. This information 
was reported up the chain, resulting in more rigorous 
screening of individuals selected for the mission, with 
no additional heat injuries and full team strength for 
the duration of the time in theater. 
Step 5. Health Risk Communication
Once the health risk assessment is complete and 
countermeasures decided upon, this information 
must be communicated to all stakeholder groups. 
Stakeholder groups include individual deployers, 
the commander, the in-garrison medical team, and 
the deployed medical team. Family members may 
also comprise a stakeholder group. The in-garrison 
medical team should be informed of the health threats 
for which deployers must be cleared and countermeasures that must be prescribed by the provider. The 
in-garrison medical team should also be informed of 
health threats that must be monitored in returning 
deployers, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and posttraumatic stress disorder. 
Health risk communication briefings should occur 
during predeployment preparation, upon arrival into 
theater, just prior to departure from theater, upon 
return to home station, and any time the threats may 
have changed. Each briefing should focus on the most 
important health threats and countermeasures for that 
portion of the deployment cycle. For example, predeployment health threat briefs might focus on personal 
protective equipment such as treatment of uniforms 
with permethrin, vaccinations, prophylactic medication prescriptions, and training and certifications for 
workplace safety. Upon arrival in theater, briefs might 
focus more on safe food and water sources, vector 
avoidance, safety and injury prevention, adherence to 
prophylactic medications, and updates in the health 
risk assessment. To get the attention of new deployers, 
diseases and injuries already seen in theater should be 
emphasized. As previously discussed, the postdeployment health threat brief is a critical opportunity to 
educate the returning deployer on any health threats 
they may have encountered, the importance of completing any postexposure prophylactic medications, 
and the importance of documenting any exposures 
that occurred during deployment. Also, any individual 
concerns should be addressed as soon as possible. Returning deployers should be reminded to report their 
recent deployment and travel history to their medical 
provider if any medical conditions develop. Finally, 
returning deployers should complete the postdeployment health assessments at the prescribed times as 
described in DoDI 6490. 03. 7 
Step 6. Command Support
The final and critical piece in FHP is command support. In addition to the need for a resilient and effective 
fighting force for mission accomplishment, the commander has a legal and ethical responsibility to care 
for the health and welfare of people under his or her 
command. The commander must balance operational 
demands with health threats; some risk may need to 
be accepted and managed. The commander depends 
on the medical officer to provide clear and concise 
health risk communication and guide the content of 
the commander’s orders and policies in this regard. 
Through sound advice, the medical officer must strive 
to gain the trust of the commander. In turn, the medical 
officer will depend on the authority of the commander 
for implementation of FHP measures.

Fundamentals of Military Medicine
Command support of FHP ensures that preventive medicine personnel are well trained, well 
equipped, and well placed to conduct the health 
risk and environmental risk assessments that must 
be accomplished per DoDI 6490. 03. Lessons learned 
from recent conflicts have shown that preventive 
medicine personnel must be involved in the early 
phases of mission analysis and planning, and they 
should be prioritized for early entry into theater. In 
this way, inadvertent exposure to environmental and 
industrial threats can be minimized. 11 In his article 
on FHP during the 2010 Pakistan flood relief,17 Major RL Burke describes a good example of command 
support. The health threats during this mission were 
substantial, involving mosquito vector threats and 
food- and water-borne threats. Command support for 
preventive medicine personnel was needed due to the 
restricted number of military personnel allowed into 
the response area. In addition, command foresight 
into the value of training all medical personnel to a 
basic level in preventive medicine skills was a force 
multiplier. 17 
SUMMARY
FHP, the prevention of disease and injury to protect the strength and capability of the military force 
for mission accomplishment, has been a part of US 
military strategy since the revolutionary era, and was 
reinvigorated following the Persian Gulf War. FHP 
spans the lifecycle of the military service member and 
can be divided into predeployment, deployment, and 
postdeployment phases; each phase includes required 
and specific health-related activities. A health surveillance program is a critical component of FHP, whether 
a unit is deployed or in garrison. Components of a 
health surveillance program include identification of 
the population at risk, conducting a health risk assessment, development of countermeasures, monitoring 
and reporting of disease and injury, health risk communication, and command support.
