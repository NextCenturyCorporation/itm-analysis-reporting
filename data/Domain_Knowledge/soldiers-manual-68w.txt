PREFACE 
 
This publication is for skill level 1, 2 and 3 Soldiers holding military occupational specialty (MOS) 
68W and for trainers and first-line supervisors. It contains standardized training objectives, in 
the form of task summaries, to train and evaluate Soldiers on critical tasks that support unit 
missions during wartime. Trainers and first-line supervisors should ensure Soldiers holding 
MOS 68WSL1/SL2/SL3 have access to this publication. This STP is available for download from 
the Central Army Registry (CAR). 
This publication applies to the Active Army, the Army National Guard (ARNG)/Army National 
Guard of the United States (ARNGUS), and the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) unless otherwise

CHAPTER 1 
Introduction 
1-1. General. This Soldier training publication (STP) identifies the individual military 
occupational specialty (MOS) training requirements for Soldiers in MOS 68W. Another source of 
STP task data is the Central Army Registry (CAR) at the Army Training (and Education) 
Network. Commanders, trainers, and Soldiers should use the STP to plan, conduct, and 
evaluate individual training in units. The STP is the primary MOS reference to support the selfdevelopment and training of every Soldier in the unit. It is used with the Soldier’s Manual of 
Common Tasks, collective training products, and ADRP 7-0, Training Units and Developing 
Leaders, to establish effective training plans and programs that integrate Soldier, leader, and 
collective tasks. This chapter explains how to use the STP in establishing an effective individual 
training program. It includes doctrinal principles and implications outlined in ADRP 7-0. Based 
on these guidelines, commanders and unit trainers must tailor the information to meet the 
requirements for their specific unit. 
 
1-2. Training Requirement. Every Soldier, noncommissioned officer (NCO), warrant officer, 
and officer has one primary mission — to be trained and ready to fight and win our nation's 
wars. Success in battle does not happen by accident; it is a direct result of tough, realistic, and 
challenging training. 
 
 
a. 
Operational Environment. 
 
 
 
(1) 
Commanders and leaders at all levels must conduct training with respect to a 
wide variety of operational missions across the full spectrum of operations. These operations 
may include combined arms, joint, multinational, and interagency considerations, and span the 
entire breadth of terrain and environmental possibilities. Commanders must strive to set the 
daily training conditions as closely as possible to those expected for actual operations. 
 
 
 
(2) 
The operational missions of the Army include not only war, but also military 
operations other than war (MOOTW). Operations may be conducted as major combat 
operations, a small-scale contingency, or a peacetime military engagement. Offensive and 
defensive operations normally dominate military operations in war along with some small-scale 
contingencies. Stability operations and support operations dominate in MOOTW. Commanders 
at all echelons may combine different types of operations simultaneously and sequentially to 
accomplish missions in war and MOOTW. These missions require training since future conflict 
will likely involve a mix of combat and MOOTW, often concurrently. The range of possible 
missions complicates training. Army forces cannot train for every possible mission; they train for 
war and prepare for specific missions as time and circumstances permit. 
 
 
 
(3) 
One type of MOOTW is the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear 
(CBRN) event. To assist commanders and leaders in training their units, CBRN-related 
information is being included in AMEDD collective training. Even though most collective tasks 
within an MTP may support a CBRN event, the ones that will most directly be impacted are 
clearly indicated with a statement in the CONDITION that reads: "THIS TASK MAY BE USED 
TO SUPPORT A CBRN EVENT." These collective tasks and any supporting individual tasks in 
this Soldier’s manual should be considered for training emphasis. 
 
 
 
(4) 
Our forces today use a train-alert-deploy sequence. We cannot count on the 
time or opportunity to correct or make up training deficiencies after deployment. Maintaining 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
2-2

forces that are ready now, places increased emphasis on training and the priority of training. 
This concept is a key link between operational and training doctrine. 
 
 
 
(5) 
Units train to be ready for war based on the requirements of a precise and 
specific mission. In the process they develop a foundation of combat skills that can be refined 
based on the requirements of the assigned mission. Upon alert, commanders assess and refine 
from this foundation of skills. In the train-alert-deploy process, commanders use whatever time 
the alert cycle provides to continue refinement of mission-focused training. Training continues 
during time available between alert notification and deployment, between deployment and 
employment, and even during employment as units adapt to the specific battlefield environment 
and assimilate combat replacements. 
 
 
b. 
How the Army Trains the Army. 
 
 
 
(1) 
Training is a team effort and the entire Army — Department of the Army, major 
commands (MACOMs), the institutional training base, units, the combat training centers (CTCs), 
each individual Soldier, and the civilian workforce — has a role that contributes to force 
readiness. Department of the Army and MACOMs are responsible for resourcing the Army to 
train. The Institutional Army, including schools, training centers, and NCO academies, for 
example, train Soldiers and leaders to take their place in units in the Army by teaching the 
doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Units, leaders, and individuals train to 
standard on their assigned critical individual tasks. The unit trains first as an organic unit and 
then as an integrated component of a team. Before the unit can be trained to function as a 
team, each Soldier must be trained to perform their individual supporting tasks to standard. 
Operational deployments and major training opportunities, such as major training exercises, and 
CTCs provide rigorous, realistic, and stressful training and operational experience under actual 
or simulated combat and operational conditions to enhance unit readiness and produce bold, 
innovative leaders. The result of this Army-wide team effort is a training and leader development 
system that is unrivaled in the world. Effective training produces the force — Soldiers, leaders, 
and units — that can successfully execute any assigned mission. 
 
 
 
(2) 
The Army Training and Leader Development Model (Refer to Figure 1-1.) 
centers on developing trained and ready units led by competent and confident leaders. The 
model depicts an important dynamic that creates a lifelong learning process. The three core 
domains that shape the critical learning experiences throughout a Soldier’s and leader’s time 
span are the operational, institutional, and self-development domains. Together, these domains 
interact using feedback and assessment from various sources and methods to maximize 
warfighting readiness. Each domain has specific, measurable actions that must occur to 
develop our leaders. 
 
• 
The operational domain includes home station training, CTC rotations, and joint 
training exercises and deployments that satisfy national objectives. Each of these 
actions provides foundational experiences for Soldier, leader, and unit 
development. 
 
• 
The institutional domain focuses on educating and training Soldiers and leaders 
on the key knowledge, skills, and attributes required to operate in any 
environment. It includes individual, unit and joint schools, and advanced 
education. 
 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
1-3 
• 
The self-development domain, both structured and informal, focuses on taking those 
actions necessary to reduce or eliminate the gap between operational and institutional 
experiences. 
 
 
 
Figure 1-1. Army Training and Leader Development Model 
 
 
 
(3) 
Throughout this lifelong learning and experience process, there is formal and 
informal assessment and feedback of performance to prepare leaders and Soldiers for their next 
level of responsibility. Assessment is the method used to determine the proficiency and potential 
of leaders against a known standard. Feedback must be clear, formative guidance directly 
related to the outcome of training events measured against standards. 
 
 
c. 
Leader Training and Leader Development. 
 
 
 
(1) 
Competent and confident leaders are a prerequisite to the successful training of 
units. It is important to understand that leader training and leader development are integral parts 
of unit readiness. Leaders are inherently Soldiers first and should be technically and tactically 
proficient in basic Soldier skills. They are also adaptive, capable of sensing their environment, 
adjusting the plan when appropriate, and properly applying the proficiency acquired through 
training. 
 
 
 
(2) 
Leader training is an expansion of these skills that qualifies them to lead other 
Soldiers. As such, doctrine and principles of training require the same level of attention of senior 
commanders. Leader training occurs in the Institutional Army, the unit, the CTCs, and through 
self-development. Leader training is just one portion of leader development. 
 
 
 
(3) 
Leader development is the deliberate, continuous, sequential, and progressive 
process, grounded in Army values, that grows Soldiers and civilians into competent and 
confident leaders capable of decisive action. Leader development is achieved through the lifeSTP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
2-4

long synthesis of the knowledge, skills, and experiences gained through institutional training and 
education, organizational training, operational experience, and self-development. Commanders 
play the key role in leader development that ideally produces tactically and technically 
competent, confident, and adaptive leaders who act with boldness and initiative in dynamic, 
complex situations to execute mission-type orders achieving the commander’s intent. 
 
 
(4) The life cycle management diagram combined with the 68W MOS Training Plan 
forms the Soldiers career development model. This information, combined with the MOS 
Training Plan in Chapter 2, forms the career development model for the MOS. 
 
 
d. Training Responsibility. Soldier and leader training and development continue in the 
unit. Using the institutional foundation, training in organizations and units focuses and hones 
individual and team skills and knowledge. 
 
(1) Commander Responsibility. 
 
 
 
 
(a) The unit commander is responsible for the wartime readiness of all elements 
in the formation. The commander is, therefore, the primary trainer of the organization and is 
responsible for ensuring that all training is conducted in accordance with the STP to the Army 
standard. 
 
 
 
 
(b) Commanders ensure STP standards are met during all training. If a Soldier 
fails to meet established standards for identified MOS tasks, the Soldier must retrain until the 
tasks are performed to standard. Training to standard on MOS tasks is more important than 
completion of a unit training event. The objective is to focus on sustaining MOS proficiency — 
this is the critical factor commanders must adhere to when training individual Soldiers in units. 
 
(2) 
NCO Responsibility. 
 
 
 
 
(a) 
A great strength of the US Army is its professional NCO Corps who takes 
pride in being responsible for the individual training of Soldiers, crews, and small teams. The 
NCO support channel parallels and complements the chain of command. It is a channel of 
communication and supervision from the Command Sergeant Major (CSM) to the First 
Sergeants (1SG) and then to other NCOs and enlisted personnel. NCOs train Soldiers to the 
non-negotiable standards published in STPs. Commanders delegate authority to NCOs in the 
support channel as the primary trainers of individual, crew, and small team training. 
Commanders hold NCOs responsible for conducting standards-based, performance-oriented, 
battle-focused training and providing feedback on individual, crew, and team proficiency. 
Commanders define responsibilities and authority of their NCOs to their staffs and subordinates.

(b) NCOs continue the Soldierization process of newly assigned enlisted 
Soldiers, and begin their professional development. NCOs are responsible for conducting 
standards-based, performance-oriented, battle-focused training. They identify specific individual, 
crew, and small team tasks that support the unit’s collective mission essential tasks; plan, 
prepare, rehearse, and execute training; and evaluate training and conduct after action reviews 
(AARs) to provide feedback to the commander on individual, crew, and small team proficiency. 
Senior NCOs coach junior NCOs to master a wide range of individual tasks. 
 
 
 
(3) Soldier Responsibility. Each Soldier is responsible for performing individual tasks 
identified by the first-line supervisor based on the unit’s mission essential task list (METL). 
Soldiers must perform tasks to the standards included in the task summary. If Soldiers have 
questions about tasks or which tasks in this manual they must perform, they are responsible for 
asking their first-line supervisor for clarification, assistance, and guidance. First-line supervisors 
know how to perform each task or can direct Soldiers to appropriate training materials, including 
current field manuals, technical manuals, and Army regulations. Soldiers are responsible for 
using these materials to maintain performance. They are also responsible for maintaining 
standard performance levels of all Soldier's Manual of Common Tasks at their current skill level 
and below. Periodically, Soldiers should ask their supervisor or another Soldier to check their 
performance to ensure that they can perform the tasks. 
 
1-3. Battle-Focused Training. Battle focus is a concept used to derive peacetime training 
requirements from assigned and anticipated missions. The priority of training in units is to train 
to standard on the wartime mission. Battle focus guides the planning, preparation, execution, 
and assessment of each organization's training program to ensure its members train as they are 
going to fight. Battle focus is critical throughout the entire training process and is used by 
commanders to allocate resources for training based on wartime and operational mission 
requirements. Battle focus enables commanders and staffs at all echelons to structure a training 
program that copes with non-mission-related requirements while focusing on mission essential 
training activities. It is recognized that a unit cannot attain proficiency to standard on every task 
whether due to time or other resource constraints. However, unit commanders can achieve a 
successful training program by consciously focusing on a reduced number of METL tasks that 
are essential to mission accomplishment. 
 
 
a. 
Linkage between METL and STP. A critical aspect of the battle focus concept is to 
understand the responsibility for and the linkage between the collective mission essential tasks 
and the individual tasks that support them. For example, the commander and the CSM/1SG 
must jointly coordinate the collective mission essential tasks and supporting individual tasks on 
which the unit will concentrate its efforts during a given period. This task hierarchy is provided in 
the task database at the Central Army Registry (CAR). The CSM/1SG must select the specific 
individual tasks that support each collective task to be trained. Although NCOs have the primary 
role in training and sustaining individual Soldier skills, officers at every echelon remain 
responsible for training to established standards during both individual and collective training. 
Battle focus is applied to all missions across the full spectrum of operations. 
 
 
b. 
Relationship of STPs to Battle-focused Training. The two key components of any STP 
are the Soldier's manual (SM) and trainer’s guide (TG). Each gives leaders important 
information to help implement the battle-focused training process. The trainer’s guide relates 
Soldier and leader tasks in the MOS and skill level to duty positions and equipment. It states 
where the task is trained, how often training should occur to sustain proficiency, and who in the 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
1-7 
unit should be trained. As leaders assess and plan training, they should rely on the trainer’s 
guide to help identify training needs. 
 
 
(1) 
Leaders conduct and evaluate training based on Army-wide training objectives 
and on the task standards published in the Soldier's manual task summaries or in the Central 
Army Registry. The task summaries ensure that -- 
 
• 
Trainers in every unit and location define task standards the same way. 
• 
Trainers evaluate all Soldiers to the same standards.

1-4. Task Summary Format. Task summaries outline the wartime performance requirements of 
each critical task in the SM. They provide the Soldier and the trainer with the information 
necessary to prepare, conduct, and evaluate critical task training. As a minimum, task 
summaries include information the Soldier must know and the skills that he must perform to 
standards for each task. The format of the task summaries included in this SM is as follows: 
 
 
a. 
Task Title. The task title identifies the action to be performed. 
 
 
b. 
Task Number. A 10-digit number identifies each task or skill. This task number, along 
with the task title, must be included in any correspondence pertaining to the task. 
 
 
c. 
Conditions. The task conditions identify all the equipment, tools, references, job aids, 
and supporting personnel that the Soldier needs to use to perform the task in wartime. This 
section identifies any environmental conditions that can alter task performance, such as 
visibility, temperature, or wind. This section also identifies any specific cues or events that 
trigger task performance, such as a chemical attack or identification of a threat vehicle. 
 
 
d. 
Standards. The task standards describe how well and to what level the task must be 
performed under wartime conditions. Standards are typically described in terms of accuracy, 
completeness, and speed.

e. 
Performance Steps. This section includes a detailed outline of information on how to 
perform the task. Additionally, some task summaries include safety statements and notes. 
Safety statements (danger, warning, and caution) alert users to the possibility of immediate 
death, personal injury, or damage to equipment. Notes provide a small, extra supportive 
explanation or hint relative to the performance steps. 
 
 
f. 
Evaluation Preparation (when used). This subsection indicates necessary 
modifications to task performance in order to train and evaluate a task that cannot be trained to 
the wartime standard under wartime conditions. It may also include special training and 
evaluation preparation instructions to accommodate these modifications and any instructions 
that should be given to the Soldier before evaluation. 
 
 
g. 
Performance Measures. This evaluation guide identifies the specific actions that the 
Soldier must do to successfully complete the task. These actions are listed in a GO/NO-GO 
format for easy evaluation. Each evaluation guide contains an evaluation guidance statement 
that indicates the requirements for receiving a GO on the evaluation. 
 
 
h. 
References. This section identifies references that provide more detailed and 
thorough explanations of task performance requirements than those given in the task summary 
description. 
 
1-5. Training Execution. All good training, regardless of the specific collective, leader, and 
individual tasks being executed, must comply with certain common requirements. These include 
adequate preparation, effective presentation and practice, and thorough evaluation. The 
execution of training includes preparation for training, conduct of training, and recovery from 
training. 
 
 
a. 
Preparation for Training. Formal near-term planning for training culminates with the 
publication of the unit training schedule. Informal planning, detailed coordination, and 
preparation for executing the training continue until the training is performed. Commanders and 
other trainers use training meetings to assign responsibility for preparation of all scheduled 
training. Preparation for training includes selecting tasks to be trained, planning the conduct of 
the training, training the trainers, reconnaissance of the site, issuing the training execution plan, 
and conducting rehearsals and pre-execution checks. Pre-execution checks are preliminary 
actions commanders and trainers use to identify responsibility for these and other training 
support tasks. They are used to monitor preparation activities and to follow up to ensure 
planned training is conducted to standard. Pre-execution checks are a critical portion of any 
training meeting. During preparation for training, battalion and company commanders identify 
and eliminate potential training distracters that develop within their own organizations. They also 
stress personnel accountability to ensure maximum attendance at training. 
 
 
 
(1) 
Subordinate leaders, as a result of the bottom-up feed from internal training 
meetings, identify and select the individual tasks necessary to support the identified training 
objectives. Commanders develop the tentative plan to include requirements for preparatory 
training, concurrent training, and training resources. At a minimum, the training plan should 
include confirmation of training areas and locations, training ammunition allocations, training 
simulations and simulators availability, transportation requirements, Soldier support items, a risk 
management analysis, assignment of responsibility for the training, designation of trainers 
responsible for approved training, and final coordination. The time and other necessary 
resources for retraining must also be an integral part of the original training plan. 
 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
1-9 
 
 
(2) 
Leaders, trainers, and evaluators are identified, trained to standard, and 
rehearsed prior to the conduct of the training. Leaders and trainers are coached on how to train, 
given time to prepare, and rehearsed so that training will be challenging and doctrinally correct. 
Commanders ensure that trainers and evaluators are not only tactically and technically 
competent on their training tasks, but also understand how the training relates to the 
organization's METL. Properly prepared trainers, evaluators, and leaders project confidence 
and enthusiasm to those being trained. Trainer and leader training is a critical event in the 
preparation phase of training. These individuals must demonstrate proficiency on the selected 
tasks prior to the conduct of training. 
 
 
 
(3) 
Commanders, with their subordinate leaders and trainers, conduct site 
reconnaissance, identify additional training support requirements, and refine and issue the 
training execution plan. The training plan should identify all those elements necessary to ensure 
the conduct of training to standard. Rehearsals are essential to the execution of good training. 
Realistic, standards-based, performance-oriented training requires rehearsals for trainers, 
support personnel, and evaluators. Preparing for training in Reserve Component (RC) 
organizations can require complex pre-execution checks. RC trainers must often conduct 
detailed coordination to obtain equipment, training support system products, and ammunition 
from distant locations. In addition, RC pre-execution checks may be required to coordinate 
Active Component assistance from the numbered CONUSA, training support divisions, and 
directed training affiliations. 
 
 
b. 
Conduct of Training. Ideally, training is executed using the crawl-walk-run approach. 
This allows and promotes an objective, standards-based approach to training. Training starts at 
the basic level. Crawl events are relatively simple to conduct and require minimum support from 
the unit. After the crawl stage, training becomes incrementally more difficult, requiring more 
resources from the unit and home station, and increasing the level of realism. At the run stage, 
the level of difficulty for the training event intensifies. Run stage training requires optimum 
resources and ideally approaches the level of realism expected in combat. Progression from the 
walk to the run stage for a particular task may occur during a one-day training exercise or may 
require a succession of training periods over time. Achievement of the Army standard 
determines progression between stages. 
 
 
 
(1) 
In crawl-walk-run training, the tasks and the standards remain the same; 
however, the conditions under which they are trained change. Commanders may change the 
conditions, for example, by increasing the difficulty of the conditions under which the task is 
being performed, increasing the tempo of the task training, increasing the number of tasks being 
trained, or by increasing the number of personnel involved in the training. Whichever approach 
is used, it is important that all leaders and Soldiers involved understand in which stage they are 
currently training and understand the Army standard. 
 
 
 
(2) 
An AAR is immediately conducted and may result in the need for additional 
training. Any task that was not conducted to standard should be retrained. Retraining should be 
conducted at the earliest opportunity. Commanders should program time and other resources 
for retraining as an integral part of their training plan. Training is incomplete until the task is 
trained to standard. Soldiers will remember the standard enforced, not the one discussed. 
 
 
c. 
Recovery from Training. The recovery process is an extension of training, and once 
completed, it signifies the end of the training event. At a minimum, recovery includes conduct of 
maintenance training, turn-in of training support items, and the conduct of AARs that review the 
overall effectiveness of the training just completed. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
2-10 
 
3 May 2013 
 
 
 
(1) 
Maintenance training is the conduct of post-operations preventive maintenance 
checks and services, accountability of organizational and individual equipment, and final 
inspections. Class IV, Class V, TADSS, and other support items are maintained, accounted for, 
and turned-in, and training sites and facilities are closed out. 
 
 
 
(2) 
AARs conducted during recovery focus on collective, leader, and individual task 
performance, and on the planning, preparation, and conduct of the training just completed. Unit 
AARs focus on individual and collective task performance, and identify shortcomings and the 
training required to correct deficiencies. AARs with leaders focus on tactical judgment. These 
AARs contribute to leader learning and provide opportunities for leader development. AARs with 
trainers and evaluators provide additional opportunities for leader development. 
 
1-6. Training Assessment. Assessment is the commander's responsibility. It is the 
commander's judgment of the organization's ability to accomplish its wartime operational 
mission. Assessment is a continuous process that includes evaluating individual training, 
conducting an organizational assessment, and preparing a training assessment. The 
commander uses his experience, feedback from training evaluations, and other evaluations and 
reports to arrive at his assessment. Assessment is both the end and the beginning of the 
training management process. Training assessment is more than just training evaluation, and 
encompasses a wide variety of inputs. Assessments include such diverse systems as training, 
force integration, logistics, and personnel, and provide the link between the unit's performance 
and the Army standard. Evaluation of training is, however, a major component of assessment. 
Training evaluations provide the commander with feedback on the demonstrated training 
proficiency of Soldiers, leaders, battle staffs, and units. Commanders cannot personally observe 
all training in their organization and, therefore, gather feedback from their senior staff officers 
and NCOs. 
 
 
a. 
Evaluation of Training. Training evaluations are a critical component of any training 
assessment. Evaluation measures the demonstrated ability of Soldiers, commanders, leaders, 
battle staffs, and units against the Army standard. Evaluation of training is integral to standardsbased training and is the cornerstone of leader training and leader development. STPs describe 
standards that must be met for each Soldier task. 
 
 
 
(1) 
All training must be evaluated to measure performance levels against the 
established Army standard. The evaluation can be as fundamental as an informal, internal 
evaluation performed by the leader conducting the training. Evaluation is conducted specifically 
to enable the individual undergoing the training to know whether the training standard has been 
achieved. Commanders must establish a climate that encourages candid and accurate 
feedback for the purpose of developing leaders and trained Soldiers. 
 
 
 
(2) 
Evaluation of training is not a test; it is not used to find reasons to punish 
leaders and Soldiers. Evaluation tells Soldiers whether or not they achieved the Army standard 
and, therefore, assists them in determining the overall effectiveness of their training plans. 
Evaluation produces disciplined Soldiers, leaders, and units. Training without evaluation is a 
waste of time and resources. 
 
 
 
(3) 
Evaluations are used by leaders as an opportunity to coach and mentor 
Soldiers. A key element in developing leaders is immediate, positive feedback that coaches and 
leads subordinate leaders to achieve the Army standard. This is a tested and proven path to 
develop competent, confident adaptive leaders.

1-11 
 
 
b. 
Evaluators. Commanders must plan for formal evaluation and must ensure the 
evaluators are trained. These evaluators must also be trained as facilitators to conduct AARs 
that elicit maximum participation from those being trained. External evaluators will be certified in 
the tasks they are evaluating and normally will not be dual-hatted as a participant in the training 
being executed. 
 
 
c. 
Role of Commanders and Leaders. Commanders ensure that evaluations take place 
at each echelon in the organization. Commanders use this feedback to teach, coach, and 
mentor their subordinates. They ensure that every training event is evaluated as part of training 
execution and that every trainer conducts evaluations. Commanders use evaluations to focus 
command attention by requiring evaluation of specific mission essential and battle tasks. They 
also take advantage of evaluation information to develop appropriate lessons learned for 
distribution throughout their commands. 
 
 
d. 
After Action Review. The AAR, whether formal or informal, provides feedback for all 
training. It is a structured review process that allows participating Soldiers, leaders, and units to 
discover for themselves what happened during the training, why it happened, and how it can be 
done better. The AAR is a professional discussion that requires the active participation of those 
being trained. FM 7-1 provides detailed instructions for conducting an AAR and detailed 
guidance on coaching and critiquing during training. 
 
1-7. Training Support. This manual includes the following information which provides additional 
training support information. 
 
 
a. 
Glossary. The glossary, which follows the last appendix, is a single comprehensive 
list of acronyms, abbreviations, definitions, and letter symbols. 
 
 
b. References. This section contains two lists of references, required and related, which 
support training of all tasks in this SM. Required references are listed in the conditions 
statement and are required for the Soldier to do the task. Related references are materials that 
provide more detailed information and a more thorough explanation of task performance.

training plan for individual training. Units have different training needs and requirements based 
on differences in environment, location, equipment, dispersion, and similar factors. Therefore, 
the MTP should be used as a guide for conducting unit training and not a rigid standard. The 
MTP consists of two parts. Each part is designed to assist the commander in preparing a unit 
training plan which satisfies integration, cross training, training up, and sustainment training 
requirements for Soldiers in this MOS. 
 
Part One of the MTP shows the relationship of an MOS skill level between duty position and 
critical tasks. These critical tasks are grouped by task commonality into subject areas. 
 
Section I lists subject area numbers and titles used throughout the MTP. These subject areas 
are used to define the training requirements for each duty position within an MOS. 
 
Section II identifies the total training requirement for each duty position within an MOS and 
provides a recommendation for cross training and train-up/merger training. 
 Duty Position Column. This column lists the duty positions of the MOS, by skill level, which 
have different training requirements. 
 Subject Area Column. This column lists, by numerical key (see Section I), the subject areas 
a Soldier must be proficient in to perform in that duty position. 
 Cross Train Column. This column lists the recommended duty position for which Soldiers 
should be cross trained. 
 Train-up/Merger Column. This column lists the corresponding duty position for the next 
higher skill level or MOSC the Soldier will merge into on promotion. 
 
Part Two lists, by general subject areas, the critical tasks to be trained in an MOS and the type 
of training required (resident, integration, or sustainment). 
 Subject Area Column. This column lists the subject area number and title in the same order 
as Section I, Part One of the MTP. 
 Task Number Column. This column lists the task numbers for all tasks included in the 
subject area. 
 Title Column. This column lists the task title for each task in the subject area. 
 Training Location Column. This column identifies the training location where the task is first 
trained to Soldier training publications standards. If the task is first trained to standard in the 
unit, the word “Unit” will be in this column. If the task is first trained to standard in the training 
base, it will identify, by brevity code (ALC, SLC, etc.), the resident course where the task was 
taught. Figure 2-1 contains a list of training locations and their corresponding brevity codes.

MOS/Skill Level Tasks 
Skill Level 1 
Subject Area 1: Vital Signs 
Measure A Patient’s Respirations 
081-831-0010 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring vital signs. You will need a watch with a second hand, 
pen and a SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care). You have 
performed a patient care hand wash. You are not in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological or 
Nuclear (CBRN) environment. 
Standards: Measure the patient’s respirations for 30 seconds and multiply by two. 
Performance Steps 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions. 
 1. Count the number of times the chest rises (inspiration) and returns to its normal position 
(expiration). Each respiratory cycle (inspiration/expiration) counts as one respiration. Normal 
ranges for respirations for each age group are as follows: 
NOTE: The patient should not be aware that his respirations are being counted. The conscious 
patient that is aware his respirations are being counted will often alter his respiratory rate by 
breathing slower and deeper. If a patient is speaking, this too may result in an inaccurate 
assessment of respirations. 
 
a. Adults: 12-20 breaths/min. 
 
b. Children (1-10 years): 15-30 breaths/min. 
 
c. Infants: (6-12 months): 25-50 breaths/min. 
 
d. Infants: (0-5 months): 25-40 breaths/min. 
 2. Evaluate the respirations. 
 
a. Depth. 
 
(1) Normal: deep, even movement of the chest. 
 
(2) Shallow: minimal rise and fall of the chest and abdomen. 
 
(3) Labored: increased effort to breathe, with possible gasping. 
 
b. Quality (character). 
 
(1) Normal: effortless, automatic, regular rate, even depth, noiseless, and free of 
discomfort. 
 
(2) Dyspnea: difficult or labored breathing. 
 
(3) Tachypnea: rapid respiratory rate; usually is a rate exceeding 24 breaths/min (adult). 
 
(4) Noisy: snoring, rattling, wheezing (whistling), or grunting. 
 
(5) Apnea: temporary absence of breathing. 
 3. Observe for physical characteristics of abnormal respirations. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-2 
 
3 May 2013 
 
a. Appearance: the patient may appear restless, anxious, pale, ashen, or cyanotic (blue 
skin color). 
 
b. Position: the patient may alter his position by leaning forward with his hands on his legs 
(tripod position) or may be unable to breathe while lying down. 
 4. Record the rate of respirations and any observations noted (depth and quality) on the SF 
600, according to local protocols and SOP. 
 5. Report any abnormal respirations to your supervisor immediately. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: You must count the rate with the Soldier being evaluated. If you are using a simulated 
patient, you may evaluate step 2 by having the patient purposely exhibit abnormal breathing 
characteristics. A tolerance of ± 2 counts will be allowed during the evaluation. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to count and record a patient's respirations.

Measure a Patient's Pulse 
081-831-0011 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions. 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring vital signs. You will need a watch with a second hand, 
a pen and a SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care). You have 
performed a patient care hand wash. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Count a patient's pulse for a minimum of 30 seconds, a full minute if irregularities 
were detected. Identify any demonstrated abnormalities in the pulse rate, rhythm, and strength. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Position the patient so the pulse site is accessible. 
 2. Palpate (feel) the pulse site. 
 
a. Place the tips of your index and middle fingers on the pulse site. Do not use your thumb 
to palpate a pulse as your thumb has its own pulse. 
 
b. Apply moderate pressure with your fingers to palpate the pulse. 
NOTE: In responsive patients, older than 1 year, you should palpate the radial pulse at the wrist. 
In unresponsive patients, older than 1 year, you should palpate the carotid pulse at the neck. In 
patients less than 1 year of age, palpate the brachial pulse. 
 
 3. Count the number of pulses felt in a 30 second period and multiply by two. A pulse that is 
weak, difficult to palpate, or irregular should be palpitated and counted for a full minute. 
 
a. The normal pulse rates (at rest) are as follows: 
 
(1) Adults: 60-100 beats/min. 
 
(2) Children (1-6 years): 70-120 beats/min. 
 
(3) Infants: (6-12 months): 80-140 beats/min. 
 
(4) Infants: (0-5 months): 90-140 beats/min. 
 
b. Pulse rates in an adult patient that exceed 100 beats/min are described as tachycardia. 
 
c. Pulse rates less than 60 beats/min are described as bradycardia. 
NOTE: Pulse rates can vary from patient to patient. In well-conditioned athletes or patients 
taking certain heart medications, the pulse rate may be considerably lower. In these adult 
patients, bradycardia may be considered normal. 
 
 4. Evaluate the pulse rhythm (regularity). 
 
a. Regular rhythm. 
 
(1) Usually easy to find. 
 
(2) Has a regular rate and rhythm. 
 
(3) Varies with the individual. 
 
b. Irregular rhythm (any change from a regular beating pattern). 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-4 
 
3 May 2013 
NOTE: If the pulse is irregular or intermittent, you should palpate a second pulse at the carotid 
or femoral site. All patients presenting with an irregular pulse rhythm should be referred to a 
medical officer. 
 
 5. Evaluate the pulse strength. 
 
a. Strong (full) pulse. 
 
(1) Usually easy to find. 
 
(2) Beats evenly and forcefully. 
 
b. Bounding (stronger than normal) pulse. 
 
(1) Easy to find. 
 
(2) Exceptionally strong heartbeats that make the arteries difficult to compress. 
 
c. Weak (thready) pulse. 
 
(1) Usually difficult to find. 
 
(2) Weak and thin. 
 6. Record the rate, rhythm, strength, and any significant deviations from normal on the SF 
600, according to local protocols and SOP. 
 7. Report any significant pulse abnormalities to your supervisor immediately. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: You must count the pulse rate with the Soldier being evaluated by palpating a 
corresponding site. Specify which site the Soldier is to palpate. A tolerance of ± 2 beats/min will 
be allowed during the evaluation. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to count and record the patient's pulse.

Measure a Patient's Blood Pressure 
081-831-0012 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions. 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring vital signs. You will need a sphygmomanometer, 
stethoscope, pen and SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care). You 
have performed a patient care hand wash. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Measure a patient's blood pressure. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Explain the procedure to the patient, if necessary. 
 
a. The length of time the procedure will take. 
 
b. The site to be used. 
 
c. The physical sensations the patient will feel. 
 2. Select the proper size of sphygmomanometer cuff. 
NOTE: The cuff width should wrap around the arm 1-1. 5 times and take up two-thirds of the 
upper arm length, if using the brachial artery, and two-thirds of the upper leg length if using the 
popliteal artery. 
NOTE: A cuff that is too small may result in falsely high readings; a cuff that is too large may 
result in falsely low readings. 
 3. Check the equipment. 
 
a. Ensure the cuff is completely deflated and fully retighten the one-way valve thumbscrew. 
 
b. Ensure the sphygmomanometer pressure gauge is reading zero. 
NOTE: The following procedures describe the procedure for obtaining a blood pressure reading 
using the upper arm (brachial artery). 
 4. Position the patient and cuff. 
 
a. Place the patient in a relaxed and comfortable sitting, standing, or lying position. 
NOTE: Measuring the blood pressure of a standing patient will result in a slightly higher reading. 
 
b. With the patient's arm extended, at approximately heart level and with the palm up, place 
the cuff over the brachial artery. Ensure the lower edge of the cuff is 1-2 inches above the elbow 
and the bladder portion is over the artery. 
 
c. Wrap the cuff just tightly enough to prevent slippage. 
 
d. Support the arm so it is in a relaxed state. 
 5. Palpate the brachial artery to determine where to place the stethoscope. 
 6. Place the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the pulse site and hold it firmly pressed 
against the artery with the fingers of your nondominant hand. 
CAUTION: The cuff should not remain inflated for more than 2 minutes. 
 7. With the valve closed tightly, inflate the cuff using the ball-pump until the cuff reads at least 
160 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) or until you no longer hear the pulse sounds. Continue 
pumping to increase the cuff's pressure by an additional 30 mm Hg. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-6 
 
3 May 2013 
 8. Determine the blood pressure reading. 
 
a. If a stethoscope is used, complete the following steps: 
 
(1) Rotate the thumbscrew in a counter clockwise motion, allowing the cuff to deflate 
slowly at about 3 mm Hg per second. 
 
(2) Watch the gauge and listen carefully. Note the patient's systolic blood pressure as 
the first distinct "taps" or "thumps" of the pulse waves that can be heard clearly. 
 
(3) Continue to watch the gauge and note the reading where the sound changes again 
or becomes muffled or disappears. This will be the diastolic blood pressure. 
 
(4) As soon as the pulse sounds cease, open the valve by rotating the thumbscrew and 
release the remaining air rapidly. 
 
b. If a stethoscope is not used, complete the following steps: 
NOTE: If in a very noisy environment where hearing the pulse waves is difficult or impossible, 
the palpation method may be used. 
 
(1) With your nondominant hand, palpate the radial pulse (at the wrist) on the same arm 
as the cuff. 
 
(2) While palpating the radial pulse, rapidly inflate the cuff until you can no longer feel 
the pulse under your fingertips, and then inflate an additional 30 mm Hg above where you last 
felt the radial pulse. 
 
(3) Rotate the thumbscrew in a counter clockwise motion, allowing the cuff to deflate 
slowly at about 3 mm Hg per second. 
 
(4) Watch the gauge, when you again feel the radial pulse return, note the reading on 
the gauge (systolic blood pressure). 
NOTE: The diastolic pressure cannot be determined using this method. If the procedure must 
be repeated, wait at least 1 minute before repeating the procedure. 
 
(5) As soon as you note the systolic reading, open the valve by rotating the thumbscrew 
and release the remaining air rapidly. 
 9. Record the blood pressure on the appropriate medical forms. 
 
a. Record the systolic reading over the diastolic reading, for example 120/80. 
 
b. If obtaining the blood pressure without a stethoscope (by palpation), record the systolic 
reading alone alongside the letter "P", for example 120/P. 
 
c. Record all readings in even numbers. 
NOTE: Record the blood pressure readings with the time it was taken on the SF 600. 
 10. Evaluate the blood pressure readings by noting the normal ranges for the blood pressure. 
 
a. Adults: 90-140 mm Hg (systolic); 60-90 mm Hg (diastolic). 
 
b. Children: (1-10 years): 80-110 mm Hg (systolic). 
 
c. Infants: (0-12 months): 70 mm Hg (systolic). 
NOTE: Blood pressure readings vary with age and gender. A patient has hypotension when the 
blood pressure is lower than the normal range; the patient has hypertension when the blood 
pressure is higher than the normal range. 
 11. Report any abnormal blood pressure findings to the supervisor immediately. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-7 
Setup: A double stethoscope should be used if available. A tolerance of ± 4 mm Hg will be 
allowed. If other methods are used, such as independent measurements on different sites or at 
different times, the evaluator must apply discretion in applying the ± 4 mm Hg standard. You will 
allow the Soldier to retake the blood pressure at least once if the Soldier feels that it is 
necessary to obtain an accurate reading. You will use discretion in allowing additional 
repetitions based upon the difficulty of obtaining a reading on the patient during the evaluation. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to take a patient's blood pressure. Tell the Soldier that the blood 
pressure may be retaken, if necessary, to obtain an accurate reading.

Measure a Patient's Temperature 
081-831-0013 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious so always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring vital signs. You will need a watch, electronic 
thermometer, alcohol pads, cover probes, water soluble lubricant, pen and SF 600 (Medical 
Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care). You have performed a patient care hand wash. 
You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Measure the patient's temperature to the nearest 0. 2° F. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Determine which site to use. 
CAUTIONS: Do not take an oral temperature when the patient-- 1. Has had recent facial or oral 
surgery. 2. Is unable to follow directions (confused, disturbed, or heavily sedated). 3. Is being 
administered oxygen by mouth or nose. 4. Is likely to bite down on the thermometer. 5. Has 
smoked, chewed gum or has eaten or drank anything hot or cold within the last 15 to 30 
minutes. 
 
a. Take an oral temperature if the patient is a conscious adult or child who can follow 
directions and can breathe normally through their nose. 
CAUTION: Do not attempt to take a tympanic temperature if the patient has had recent facial or 
ear surgery or has cerumen (ear wax) impaction. 
 
b. The tympanic method may be used with conscious or unconscious patients and is the 
preferred method if the patient has recently had anything to eat or drink. 
CAUTION: Do not attempt to take a rectal temperature if the patient has had recent rectal 
surgery, unless directed to by a medical officer. Do not attempt to take a rectal temperature on 
an infant unless directed by a medical officer. 
 
c. Obtain the patient's temperature by the rectal method if the oral or tympanic methods are 
ruled out by the patient's condition. 
 
d. Obtain the patient's temperature by the axillary (least preferred) method if the patient's 
condition rules out using the other methods. 
 2. Select the appropriate thermometer. 
 
a. Tympanic thermometer. 
 
b. Oral thermometer: has a blue tip and may be labeled "Oral." 
 
c. Rectal thermometer: has a red tip and may be labeled "Rectal." 
 
d. Axillary temperatures may be obtained using an oral thermometer. 
 3. Explain the procedure and position the patient appropriately. 
 
a. Tympanic method. Position the patient with their head turned to make the ear canal 
easily accessible. 
 
b. Oral method. Position the patient seated or lying down. 
 
c. Rectal method. Position the patient lying on either side with the top knee flexed. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-9 
 
d. Axillary method. Position the patient either seated or lying face up with the armpit 
exposed. 
 4. Measure the temperature. 
 
a. Place the thermometer at the proper site. 
 
(1) Oral method. Ensure cover probe is firmly attached to the appropriate probe 
attachment. Digital disinfect the thermometer with an alcohol pad. Insert it into the disposable 
sheath opening; then twist to tear the seal at the dotted line. Pull it apart. Place the thermometer 
underneath the patient’s tongue. Instruct the patient to close their lips around the instrument 
firmly but not to bite down. 
CAUTION: The rectal thermometer with the cover probe attached must be lubricated with a 
water soluble lubricant prior to insertion. Once inserted, do not let go of the thermometer. 
 
(2) Rectal method. Ensure cover probe is firmly attached to the appropriate probe. In an 
adult, insert the thermometer 1 to 2 inches into their rectum. Lift the patient’s upper buttock and 
ask the patient to take a slow deep breath. This helps relax the anal sphincter to ease insertion 
of the thermometer. 
 
(3) Tympanic method. Pull the ear pinna upward and rearward; insert the thermometer 
speculum into the ear canal snugly to create a seal, pointing toward the nose. 
 
(4) Axillary method. Pat the armpit dry and place the tip end of an oral thermometer with 
cover probe firmly attached, in the center of the armpit with the probe attachment tip protruding 
to the front of the patient's body. Place the patient's arm across his chest. 
 
b. Leave the thermometer in place for the required time. 
 
(1) Oral method: must remain in place for at least 3 minutes. 
NOTE: If using a digital oral thermometer, leave in place until testing is complete. The digital 
unit will normally have an audible tone. 
 
(2) Rectal method: must be held in place for at least 2 minutes. 
 
(3) Tympanic method: must remain in place until an audible signal occurs and the 
patient's temperature appears on the digital display. 
 
(4) Axillary method: must remain in place for at least 10 minutes. 
 5. Remove the thermometer and eject the cover probe, or discharge the protective plastic 
sheath as appropriate. 
 6. Read the temperature scale or digital display. 
 7. Evaluate the temperature reading. The normal temperature ranges are as follows: 
 
a. Oral method: 97. 0° to 99. 0° F. 
 
b. Rectal method: 98. 0° to 100. 0° F. 
 
c. Tympanic method: 97. 0° to 99. 0° F. 
 
d. Axillary method: 96. 0° to 98. 0° F. 
 8. Place the thermometer back on the charger or turn off as appropriate. 
 9. Record the patient's temperature to the nearest 0. 2° F on the appropriate medical forms. 
Record a rectal temperature with an "R" on the patient's record; with an axillary reading, use an 
"A" on the patient's record. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-10

 10. Report any significant temperature abnormalities to the supervisor immediately. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: To test step 1 for evaluation purposes, create a scenario in which the patient's condition 
will dictate which site the Soldier must choose. A tolerance of ± 0. 2° F will be allowed during the 
evaluation. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to measure, evaluate, and record a patient's temperature.

Measure a Patients Oxygen Saturation 
081-831-0164 
Condition: You need to measure a patient's pulse oxygen saturation. You will need a pulse 
oximetry device, sensing probe, alcohol swabs, pen and SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological 
Record of Medical Care). You have performed a patient care hand wash. You are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Measure a patient's pulse oxygen saturation. 
Performance Steps 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
 1. Select the appropriate sensing probe location for the patient. 
 
a. For adults, sensing probes can be placed on the index, middle, or ring finger. 
 
b. Sensing probes can also be placed on the toe unless the patient has decreased 
circulation to the lower extremities. 
 
c. Earlobe clips and neonate sensing probes for the foot are available for infants and 
newborns. 
 2. Wipe the selected site with alcohol to ensure it is clean and dry. 
 3. Apply the sensor so that the emitting light is directly opposite to the detector. 
 4. Attach the sensor cable to the machine and turn the power on. 
 5. Notify the medical officer if the digital readout is below the prescribed parameters. 
NOTE : Normal pulse oximetry values will be greater than 95% in room air, with the majority 
being between 98% and 100%. Factors that may provide falsely high readings include carbon 
monoxide poisoning, hypovolemia, and certain types of toxins. 
 6. Document the oximeter reading, the location of the device, the time taken, and the amount 
of oxygen being delivered (if applicable) on the SF 600. 
 7. Take appropriate measures for continuous monitoring, if applicable. 
 
a. Ensure the alarms are on before leaving the patient. 
NOTE: Monitors come with preset limits. These limits can be changed per medical officer's 
order. 
CAUTION: The pulse oximeter is just a tool; do not rely on it solely for indications of the 
patient's condition. Treat the patient, not the machine. 
 
b. Move sensing probe locations every 2 hours; move adhesive sensors every 4 hours. 
Evaluation Preparation: Score each Soldier according to the performance measures in the 
evaluation guide. Unless otherwise stated in the task summary, the Soldier must pass all 
performance measures to be scored GO. If the Soldier fails any step, show what was done 
wrong and how to do it correctly. 
Setup: Have all materials present for the evaluation. Have another Soldier act as the patient. 
Tell the patient not to assist the Soldier in any way. 
Brief the Soldier: Tell the Soldier to measure the patient's pulse oxygen saturation.

NOTE: As the FMC is the first, and sometimes only, record of treatment of combat casualties, 
accuracy and thoroughness of information provided is of the utmost importance. 
 4. Attach the completed FMC to the casualty's uniform by twisting the wire after threading it 
through the top buttonhole of the uniform. Keep the FMC in plain view. 
NOTE: Do not attach the FMC to the casualty's body armor as this equipment will be separated 
from the casualty once they arrive at the medical treatment facility (MTF). 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation construct a combat casualty scenario. Have another Soldier 
act as a casualty and have him respond to the Soldier's questions with personal data according 
to the scenario provided. Ensure the Soldier acting as the casualty has read the scenario 
thoroughly. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to complete the FMC by asking appropriate questions of the 
casualty. Tell the casualty to respond to the Soldier's questions with necessary information 
according to the scenario provided. To test step 2, you may either have the Soldier complete the 
required blocks, or you may require the completion of all blocks. After step 2, ask the Soldier 
what must be done with each copy of the FMC.

Administer External Chest Compressions 
081-831-0046 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You have an unresponsive, apneic and pulseless casualty. You will need a pocket 
mask with one-way-valve, oxygen, bag-valve-mask, pen and SF 600 (Medical RecordChronological Record of Medical Care). Another Soldier who is cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR) qualified, may arrive and be available to assist you, while you are performing single 
rescuer CPR. You have taken appropriate body substance isolation precautions and are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Administer CPR until the pulse is restored or until you are relieved by other 
competent person(s), are too exhausted to continue, the casualty is pronounced dead by an 
authorized person, or enemy fire prevents you from continuing until the casualty can be moved 
behind cover. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Establish unresponsiveness (gently shake the casualty, asking, "Are you OK?"). 
 
a. Assess the victim for a response and look for normal or abnormal breathing. 
NOTE: If there is no response and no breathing or no normal breathing (i.e. only gasping), shout 
for help. 
 
b. Tap the casualty's shoulder and shout, "Are you all right?" 
 
c. If the casualty is unresponsive, continue with step 2. 
 
d. If responsive, continue evaluating the casualty. 
 2. Activate the Emergency Response System. 
 3. Check for signs of circulation. 
 
a. Attempt to palpate the casualty's carotid pulse (do not take more than 10 seconds). 
 
b. If the casualty has a carotid pulse but is not breathing, perform rescue breathing. (See 
task 081-831-0048.) 
 
c. If you do not definitely feel a pulse within 10 seconds, perform 5 cycles of compressions 
and breaths (30:2 ratio) starting with compressions (C-A-B sequence). 
 4. Begin chest compressions. 
 
a. Ensure that the casualty is positioned on a hard, flat surface, in a supine position. Kneel 
next to the casualty. 
NOTE: If you suspect the casualty has a head or neck injury, try to keep the head, neck and 
torso in a line when rolling the casualty to a face up position. 
 
b. Position yourself at the casualty's side. 
 
c. Place the heel of one hand on the center of the casualty's chest on the lower half of the 
breastbone. 
NOTE: You may either extend or interlace your fingers but keep your fingers off the casualty's 
chest. 
 
d. Put the heel of your other hand on top of the first hand. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-33 
NOTE: You may either extend or interlace your fingers, but keep your fingers off of the 
casualty's chest. 
 
e. Straighten your arms and lock your elbows and position your shoulders directly over your 
hands. 
 
f. Give 30 compressions. 
 
(1) Push hard and fast. 
 
(2) Press down at least 2 inches (5cm) with each compression. 
NOTE: For each chest compression, make sure you push straight down on the casualty's breast 
bone. This will require hard work. Adequate depth must be attained for at least 23 of the 30 
compressions. 
 
g. Deliver compressions in a smooth fashion at a rate of at least 100 per minute, (i.e. an 
adequate rate would be 30 compressions in 18 seconds or less). 
 
h. At the end of each compression, make sure you allow the chest to recoil (re-expand) 
completely. 
CAUTION: Do not move the casualty while CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is in progress 
unless the casualty is in a dangerous environment, or if you cannot perform CPR effectively in 
the casualty's present position or location. 
 
i. Minimize interruptions. 
NOTE: Do not remove the heel of your hand from the casualty's chest or reposition your hands 
between compressions. 
 5. Open the airway. (See task 081-831-0018.) 
NOTE: There are two methods of opening the airway to provide breaths, the head tilt-chin lift or 
the jaw thrust. 
 6. Give two full rescue breaths. 
 
a. Move quickly to the casualty's head and lean over his mouth. 
 
b. Give two full rescue breaths (each lasting 1 second). 
NOTE: Deliver air over one second to make the casualty's chest rise. 
 7. Continue to alternate between chest compressions and ventilations (30:2) until: 
 
a. The casualty is revived. 
 
b. You are too exhausted to continue. 
 
c. You are relieved by another health care provider. 
 
d. The casualty is pronounced dead by an authorized person. 
 
e. A second rescuer states, "I know CPR," and joins you in performing two-rescuer CPR. 
 8. Limit pulse checks. 
 9. Perform two-rescuer CPR, if applicable. 
NOTE: When performing two-rescuer CPR, the rescuers must change position every 2 minutes 
to avoid fatigue and increase the effectiveness of compressions. 
 
a. Compressor: Give 30 chest compressions at the rate of 100 per minute. 
 
b. Compress the chest at least 2 inches (5cm). 
 
c. Allow the chest to recoil competely after each compression. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-34 
 
3 May 2013 
 
d. Minimize interruptions in compressions, (limit any interruptions to less than 10 seconds). 
 
e. Count compressions aloud. 
 
f. Switch duties with the second rescuer every 5 cycles or about 2 minutes, taking less than 
5 seconds to switch. 
 
g. Ventilator: Maintain an open airway. (See task 081-831-0018.) 
CAUTION: Do not push on the abdomen. If the casualty vomits, turn the casualty on his side, 
clear the airway (suction), and the continue CPR (If you suspect trauma, logroll the patient as a 
unit, clear the airway (suction), and then continue CPR). 
 
h. Give breaths, watching for chest rise and avoiding excessive ventilation. 
NOTE: If signs of gastric distension are noted, do the following: 1. Recheck and reposition the 
airway. 2. Watch for rise and fall of the chest. 3. Ventilate the casualty only enough to cause the 
chest to rise. 
NOTE: If the casualty is intubated, the ratio of breaths to compressions becomes asynchronous. 
Give 100 compressions per minute with a ventilation rate of approximately 10 to 12 per minute. 
 
i. Encourage the first rescuer/compressor to perform compressions that are deep enough 
and fast enough to allow complete chest recoil between compressions. 
 
j. Switch duties with the second rescuer every 5 cycles or about 2 minutes taking less than 
5 seconds to switch. 
 10. Continue to perform CPR as stated in the task standard. 
NOTE: The rescuer doing rescue breathing should recheck the carotid pulse every 3 to 5 
minutes. 
CAUTION: During evacuation, CPR or rescue breathing should be continued en route if 
necessary. 
 11. Continue evaluating the casualty when the pulse and breathing are restored. If the 
casualty's condition permits, place him in the recovery position. (See task 081-831-0018.) 
 12. Document the procedure on the SF 600. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, a CPR mannequin must be used. Place the mannequin face 
up on the floor (in the supine position). One-Rescuer, Two-Rescuer or a combination of both 
(see NOTE after step 14e) can be evaluated. If two Soldiers are involved, they will be 
designated as "rescuer #1" and "rescuer #2." Rescuer #1 will start in the chest compression 
position and will be the only one scored during performance of the task. The evaluator will 
ensure that all aspects of the task are evaluated by indicating whether the pulse is present and 
when the rescuers would change positions. 
Brief Soldier: If two Soldiers are involved, tell them about their roles as rescuer #1 and #2. Ask 
rescuer #1 on what type of surface the casualty should be positioned. Then, tell the Soldier(s) to 
perform One-Rescuer or Two-Rescuer CPR as appropriate.

Initiate Treatment for High Altitude Illness 
081-833-0035 
Conditions: You have a casualty requiring treatment for altitude illness. You will need a 
stethoscope, aspirin, humidified oxygen (O2) and O2 delivery equipment, a DD Form 1380 US 
Field Medical Card (FMC) and acetazolamide. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Initiate treatment for high altitude illness without further injury to the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Recognize the signs and symptoms of various types of high-altitude illness. 
 
a. Acute mountain sickness (AMS). 
NOTE: AMS is the most common form of altitude sickness and may develop at altitudes as low 
as 6,500 feet. 
 
(1) Headache. 
 
(2) Fatigue. 
 
(3) Nausea. 
 
(4) Dyspnea. 
 
(5) Sleep disturbances. 
 
(6) Symptoms are aggravated by exertion. 
NOTE: AMS may evolve into high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), high-altitude cerebral 
edema (HACE), or both. 
 
b. High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE). 
NOTE: HACE is believed to be present to a mild degree in all forms of altitude sickness. HACE 
can occur within 3-5 days after arrival at 9,000 feet, but generally occurs at altitudes above 
12,000 feet. 
 
(1) Gait ataxia is a reliable early warning sign. 
 
(2) Headache. 
 
(3) Mental confusion. 
 
(4) Hallucinations. 
WARNING: Coma and death may develop within a few hours of the first warning signs of 
HACE. 
 
(5) Irrational behavior progressing to coma. 
 
c. HAPE. 
NOTE: HAPE usually develops 24 to 96 hours after rapid ascent above 8,000 feet. 
 
(1) HAPE is characterized by increasing dyspnea. 
 
(2) Irritative cough that produces frothy, often bloody sputum. 
 
(3) Weakness. 
 
(4) Cyanosis. 
 
(5) Low-grade fever. 
 
(6) Tachycardia. 
 
(7) Fine or coarse rales. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-37 
 
(8) Coma. 
WARNING: HAPE may worsen rapidly. Coma and death may occur within hours. 
 2. Initiate prophylactic measures to prevent high-altitude illnesses. 
 
a. Altitude sickness is best prevented by slow ascent. 
 
b. Most individuals can ascend to 5,000 feet in 1 day without symptoms. 
 
c. Above 5,000 feet, a rate of 1,500 feet per day is advisable. 
NOTE: All rates are variable. A climber should learn how fast he can ascend without developing 
symptoms. A climbing party should be paced to its slowest member. 
 
d. Although physical fitness enables greater exertion with lower oxygen (O2) consumption, 
it does not protect against any form of altitude sickness. 
 
e. Increased hydration with moderate salt restriction may prevent or diminish symptoms of 
AMS. 
 
f. Eating frequent, small meals that are high in easily digestible carbohydrates improves 
altitude tolerance. 
 
g. Acetazolimide 125-250 milligrams (mg) twice a day beginning on day 1 before ascent 
and continuing for 2 days at maximum altitude is an effective prophylactic for AMS. 
 3. Manage high-altitude illnesses. 
 
a. AMS. 
 
(1) Descent, if mission allows, will provide the quickest resolution of symptoms. 
 
(2) Increase fluid intake. 
 
(3) Give aspirin or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for altitude headache. 
 
(4) Antiemetic. 
 
(5) Light diet. 
 
(6) Avoid any additional ascent or exertion until symptoms resolve. 
 
(7) Monitor patient for symptom progression to HAPE/HACE. 
 
b. HACE. 
 
(1) HACE requires immediate descent. 
 
(2) Give acetazolimide 125 -250 mg twice a day. 
 
(3) Give dexamethasone 4 mg orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously every 6 hours. 
 
c. HAPE. 
 
(1) Bed rest and oxygen at high altitude may be tried with mild HAPE, depending on 
mission requirements.

081-833-0002 
Conditions: You have a seizing patient requiring management. You will need padding 
materials, oxygen, suction equipment, non-rebreather or bag-valve-mask, pen and SF 600 
(Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care). You have performed a patient care 
hand wash and taken appropriate body substance isolation precautions. You are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Complete all steps to manage a seizing patient without causing unnecessary injury 
to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Identify the type of seizure based upon the following signs and symptoms. 
 
a. Petit mal. 
 
(1) Brief loss of concentration or awareness without loss of motor tone. 
 
(2) Lip smaking or eye blinking. 
 
(3) Occurs mainly in children and is rarely an emergency. 
 
b. Grand mal (generalized). 
 
(1) May be preceded by an aura. 
 
(2) Has two phases. 
 
 
(a) Tonic/Clonic Phase--characterized by rigidity and stiffening of the body, drooling 
and occasional cyanosis around the face and lips. 
 
 
(b) Postictal Phase-begins when convulsions stop. The patient may regain 
consciousness and enter a state of drowsiness and confusion or remain unconscious for several 
hours. 
 
(3) May involve incontinence, biting of the tongue (rare), cyanosis or mental confusion. 
 
c. Status Epilepticus. 
 
(1) Two or more seizures without an intervening period of consciousness or a seizure 
lasting more than 30 minutes. 
 
(2) A medical emergency. If untreated it may lead to: 
NOTE: Mentally note the aspects of seizure activity for recording after the seizure. 
 
 
(a) Aspiration of secretions. 
 
 
(b) Cerebral or tissue hypoxia. 
 
 
(c) Brain damage or death. 
 
 
(d) Fractures of long bones. 
 
 
(e) Head trauma. 
 
 
(f) Injured tongue from biting. 
CAUTION: Never place anything in the mouth of a seizing patient. 
 2. Maintain the airway of a patient exhibiting tonic-clonic movement. 
 3. Place the patient on his side if possible.

a. Observe the patient to prevent aspiration and suffocation. 
CAUTION: Do not elevate the patient's head and do not restrain the patient's limbs during 
seizures. 
 
b. Place patient on high-flow oxygen at 15 L/min via non-rebreathing mask if available. 
 4. Prevent injury to tissue and bones by padding or removing objects on which the patient may 
injure himself. 
 5. Manage the patient after the convulsive state has ended. 
 
a. Place the patient on his side if necessary. 
 
b. Continue to maintain the patient's airway. 
NOTE: A patient who has just had a grand mal seizure will sometimes drool and will usually be 
drowsy so you must be prepared to suction if equipment is available. 
 
c. Administer supplemental oxygen, if available, via non-rebreather mask or bag-valvemask if not available earlier. 
CAUTION: Sudden, loud noises may cause another seizure. 
 
d. If possible, place the patient in a quiet, reassuring atmosphere. 
 6. Record the seizure activity on SF 600. 
 
a. Duration of seizure. 
 
b. Presence of cyanosis, breathing difficulty or apnea. 
 
c. Level of consciousness before, during and after the seizure. 
 
d. Whether preceded by an aura, (ask patient). 
 
e. Muscles involved. 
 
f. Type of motor activity. 
 
g. Incontinence. 
 
h. Eye movement. 
 
i. Previous history of seizures, head trauma and/or drug or alcohol abuse. 
NOTE: If the seizure is witnessed, be sure to ask if they saw the patient fall, how he landed, 
how the patient was moving during the seizure and how long the seizure lasted.

081-833-0011 
Conditions: You have a conscious patient who is complaining of chest pain. You have taken 
body substance isolation precautions (BSI). You have performed the initial assessment and the 
focused history and physical exam. You will need an oxygen tank setup, non-rebreather mask, a 
stethoscope, sphygmomanometer, pulse oximetry, alcohol swabs, pen, SF 600 (Medical 
Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care), and you are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Complete all steps to manage a patient with a suspected cardiac emergency 
without causing further injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Identify signs and symptoms of possible cardiac emergency or compromise. 
 
a. Altered mental status. 
 
(1) Unresponsiveness. 
 
(2) Sleepiness. 
 
(3) Head-bobbing. 
 
(4) Agitation. 
 
(5) Anxiety. 
 
b. Chief complaint of chest, neck, back, or jaw pain/discomfort. 
NOTE: A patient with a clenched fist over their chest is a sign of chest pain or discomfort. 
 
c. Severe difficulty breathing, including inability to speak only a few words per sentence. 
 
d. Poor skin color, including pale grey or cyanotic (blue); cool, moist skin. 
 
e. Abnormally slow or fast respiratory rates. 
 
f. Abnormal pulse (arrhythmia). 
 
(1) Bradycardia (less than 60 beats per minute). 
 
(2) Tachycardia (greater than 100 beats per minute). 
 
g. Abnormal blood pressure. 
 
(1) Hypotensive (systolic pressure less than 90 mmHg). 
 
(2) Hypertensive (systolic pressure greater than 150 mmHg). 
 
h. Shallow respirations with any respiratory rate. 
 2. Administer the appropriate treatment. 
 
a. Place patient in position of comfort. 
NOTE: Position of comfort is generally the Fowler's position. 
 
b. Apply high concentration oxygen via a non-rebreather mask at 15 lpm (liters per minute). 
CAUTION: Don't forget to ask the patient what their blood pressure is normally before you take 
your reading. This will help you know what to expect and be able to determine if it is normal for 
the patient. 
 
c. Obtain baseline vital signs. 
 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-59 
WARNING: Prior to assisting patient with their prescribed medication of nitroglycerin, contact 
medical direction and give the patient's vital signs, especially the systolic blood pressure 
reading. Nitroglycerin is contraindicated for patient(s) whose systolic blood pressure is less than 
100 mmHg and/or who is taking medication to treat erectile dysfunction. 
 
d. Assist the patient in taking their nitroglycerin, if available and IAW local protocol. 
NOTE: You must call medical control for approval to assist with the patient's prescribed 
nitroglycerin. All signs and symptoms of chest pain/cardiac compromise must be in place before 
assisting the patient with their medication. 
 
(1) Check the six rights. 
 
(2) Remove the oxygen mask. 
 
(3) Ask the patient to open their mouth and lift their tongue. 
CAUTION: Avoid contact with Nitroglycerin and your bare skin. The vasodilation affects could 
cause unconsciousness. 
 
(4) Place the tablet or spray (if using mist) under the tongue with a gloved hand. 
 
(5) Have the patient close their mouth and hold the tablet under their tongue 
(sublingually) and allow it to dissolve completely. 
NOTE: Inform the patient that nitroglycerin can produce a stinging or burning sensation under 
the tongue. It may also cause them to experience a headache due to the rapid vasodilation that 
occurs. 
 
(6) Replace the oxygen mask. 
 
(7) Recheck the blood pressure within 2 minutes. 
NOTE: If the systolic blood pressure falls below 100 mmHg, treat the patient for shock and 
transport immediately. You might want to have an ALS (advanced life support) team meet you in 
route to the nearest medical facility. 
 
e. If the patient experiences no relief from chest pain, nitroglycerin can be repeated up to 
three tablets provided the systolic blood pressure remains above 100 mmHg and approval is 
given by medical control. 
 3. Transport promptly to the nearest medical facility. 
 4. Perform an ongoing assessment while enroute. 
 5. Document all interventions on a SF 600. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: Have one Soldier be the patient while the Soldier being evaluated administers treatment. 
Tell the Soldier who is acting as the patient the signs and symptoms he should exhibit and how 
to answer the questions asked by the Soldier being tested.

Bandage an Open Wound 
081-833-0068 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You have a patient with an open wound that needs bandaged. You have treated all 
other immediate life threats and taken BSI (body substance isolation) precautions. You will need 
sterile roller bandages, sterile gauze pads, 4 inch gauze rolls, self-adhering bandages, tape, 
pen and SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care). You are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Bandage an open wound without causing further injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Perform an EMT-B trauma assessment. (See task 081-833-0053.) 
 2. Select the bandaging material for the injury. 
 3. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
 4. Ask the patient about any allergies to adhesive tape. 
 5. Check distal pulses for circulation, sensory and motor (CSM) prior to application of bandage 
to an open wound. 
 6. Prepare the patient for bandaging by positioning the body part in a position of function, if 
able. 
 7. Place a waterproof pad (chux) underneath the patient. 
 8. Apply the dressing to the wound. 
 
a. The dressing should be large enough to extend beyond the wound on all sides. 
NOTE: If necessary, apply additional dressings to adequately cover the wound. 
 
b. Avoid touching the dressing in the area that will come in contact with the wound. 
NOTE: If sterile dressings are not available; select the cleanest material available. 
 
c. Grasp the dressing by the corner, taking it directly from its protective pack and place it on 
the wound. 
WARNING: Do not remove the first dressing if it becomes blood soaked. This dressing is 
helping with the formation of a clot. 
 
d. If dressing becomes blood soaked, add additional dressings on top. 
 9. Select the most appropriate size bandage to secure the dressing in place. 
 
a. Tape may be appropriate for small wounds or wounds to the torso. 
 
b. For wounds on the head or extremeties, roller gauze or triangular bandages work best. 
NOTE: Point pressure can occur if you bandage around a very small area. Avoid bandaging 
over a joint. 
 10. Apply the bandage. 
 
a. For wounds of the hand, maintian position of function during bandaging by placing a roll 
of gauze in the patient's hand prior to applying the bandage. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-64 
 
3 May 2013 
NOTE: When bandaging the hands and feet, if possible, leave the fingers and toes exposed so 
CSM can be assessed. 
 
b. Start at the narrowest part of the limb and work your way up from there. 
 
c. To begin the bandage, make two or three wraps directly over one another to ensure a 
firm foundation for the bandage. 
 
d. Overlap each spiral approximately one-third (1/3) to one-half (1/2) to ensure adequate 
coverage of the dressing. 
 
e. Secure the self-adhering roller bandage with several overlying wraps. 
 
f. Overlap the bandage, keeping it snug. 
NOTE: Be careful not to interfere with circulation. 
 
g. The bandage should extend beyond the dressing on all sides. 
CAUTION: Make sure there are no loose ends of cloth, gauze or tape that could get caught 
when the patient is transported. 
 
h. Secure the bandage with tape or a square knot. 
 11. Check circulation after application of the bandage. 
 
a. Check pulse distal to the wound. 
 
b. Check CSM function to ensure that the bandage is not too tight. 
 
c. Check for capillary refill (<2 seconds is normal), if applicable. 
 
d. Inspect the skin below the bandaging for pale or cyanotic skin. 
 
e. Ask the patient if they are experiencing any numbness, tingling sensation, coldness in 
the bandaged part or pain. 
NOTE: These are indicators that the bandage may be too tight. 
 12. Check for irritation. 
 
a. Ask the patient if the bandage rubs. 
 
b. Check for bandage wrinkles near the skin surface. 
 
c. Check for red skin or sores (ulcers) when the bandage is removed. 
 
d. Remove and reapply only the bandage if necessary. 
NOTE: If appropriate, immobilize the limb and watch to see that the bleeding remains controlled 
and check for edema during transport. 
 13. Keep the patient at rest. 
 14. Evacuate the patient if necessary. 
 15. Record the treatment given on the SF 600. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the patient.

Initiate Treatment for Hypovolemic Shock 
081-833-0047 
Conditions: You have a casualty who is suffering from a significant blood loss. You will need 
an intravenous (IV) infusion set, IV fluids, (specifically Hextend), stethoscope, 
sphygmomanometer, a blanket or poncho, pen and a DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card 
(FMC). You are in the field, you have taken body substance isolation precautions (BSI), and you 
are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Initiate treatment for hypovolemic shock, stabilize the casualty, minimize the effect 
of shock, and prepare for immediate evacuation without further injury to the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Control bleeding. (See task 081-833-0124.) 
 2. Maintain the airway. 
NOTE: Administer oxygen, if available. (See task 081-833-0158.) 
 3. Reassure the casualty to reduce anxiety. 
NOTE: Anxiety increases the heart rate, which worsens the casualty's condition. Anyone who 
has just been shot or who has experienced detonation of explosives nearby will have 
tachycardia. 
 4. Initiate one large bore (18 gauge) IV. (See task 081-833-0033.) 
NOTE: To replace fluid loss accompanying injury with hemorrhage, Hextend is the fluid of 
choice. 
 5. Infuse Hextend. 
 
a. Give the casualty 500 ml of hextend.

Conditions: You have a casualty with an open chest injury. You will need a DD Form 1380 US 
Field Medical Card (FMC). You have managed all other immediate life threats. You have 
performed a patient care hand wash, taken body substance isolation precautions and you are 
not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Initiate treatment on an open chest wound without causing further injury to the 
casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Perform a combat casualty assessment. (See task 081-833-0067.) 
 2. Check the casualty for signs and symptoms of chest injuries. 
 
a. Deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures/penetrations (DCAP), bleeding, 
tenderness, lacerations, swelling (BTLS). 
 
b. Pleuritic pain that is increased by or occurs with respirations and is localized around the 
injury site. 
 
c. Labored or difficult breathing. 
 
d. Diminished or absent breath sounds. 
 
e. Cyanotic lips, fingertips or fingernails. 
 
f. Coughing up blood or bloody sputum. 
 
g. Failure of one or both sides of the chest to expand normally upon inhalation. 
 
h. Paradoxical breathing-the motion of the injured segment of a flail chest, opposite to the 
normal motion of the chest wall. 
 
i. Enlarged neck veins. 
 
j. Coughing up blood or bloody sputum. 
 
k. Tracheal deviation-shift of the trachea from the midline toward the unaffected side due to 
pressure buildup on the injured side.

Initiate Treatment for Chemical Burns of the Eye 
081-833-0044 
Conditions: You have a casualty with a chemical burn of the eye. All other more serious 
injuries have been assessed and treated. You have performed a patient care handwash. You 
will need irrigation equipment, irrigation solution (sterile water, sterile normal saline, or potable 
water), sterile dressings, gloves, field dressings, and a DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card 
(FMC). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Initiate treatment for chemical burns of the eye without causing further injury to the 
casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Reassure the casualty. 
 2. Identify the substance the casualty was exposed to. 
NOTE: Do not delay treatment to perform this step. 
 
a. Alkali-the most dangerous of all substances due to penetrating factor (common 
substances contain the hydroxides of ammonia, lye, potassium, magnesium, and lime). 
 
(1) Fertilizers. 
 
(2) Cleaning products, drain cleaners, and oven cleaners. 
 
(3) Plaster and cement. 
 
b. Acid-usually less severe than alkali burns (common acids contain sulfuric acid, 
hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, chromic acid and hydrofluoric acid). 
 
(1) Glass polish, vinegar, and nail polish remover. 
 
(2) Automobile battery acid. 
 
c. Irritants-substances that have a neutral pH, tend to cause more discomfort to the eye 
than actual damage. 
 
(1) Most household detergents. 
 
(2) Pepper spray. 
 3. Check for signs and symptoms. 
 
a. Irritation. 
 
b. Pain and redness. 
 
c. Watering or tearing. 
 
d. Possible erosion of the corneal surface. 
 
e. Inability to keep the eye open. 
 
f. Swelling of eyelid. 
 
g. Blurred vision. 
 4. Initiate treamtent for the chemical burn. 
 
a. IMMEDIATELY flood the eyes with water. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-71 
 
b. Keep irrigating the eye with running water from a faucet, low pressure hose, bottle, cup, 
IV setup. Hold the irrigating tip 1 to 1 ½ inch away from the casualty’s eye(s), direct the irrigating 
solution gently from the inner canthus to the outer canthus. 
 
c. Start the transport and continue washing out the eye(s) for at least 20 minutes or until the 
casualty’s arrival at the treatment facility. 
 
d. Dry the area around the eye(s) by gently patting with gauze sponges. Do not touch the 
casualty’s eye. 
 
e. Cover the injured eye(s) with a clean, sterile dressing. 
NOTE: In a combat environment, the eyes may have to remain uncovered so the casualty can 
see to get away from danger. 
Burned eyelids swell to protect the underlying eyes. If the casualty can be evacuated 
immediately, the eyes may be loosely covered with sterile dressings moistened with sterile 
saline. 
 5. Record the treatment given on the FMC. 
 6. Evacuate the casualty. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use another Soldier to be the simulated casualty.

Initiate Treatment for a Soft Tissue Injury 
081-833-0063 
Conditions: You have a casualty with a soft tissue injury. You have treated all life threats. You 
have performed a patient care hand wash and taken body substance isolation (BSI) 
precautions. You will need the casualty’s medical record, normal saline, sterile water, gauze, 
non-sterile gloves, marker, a needle, No. 11 blade or tissue forceps, dressing materials, wrap, 
antibiotic ointment, tape, pen and SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical 
Care). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Initiate treatment for a soft tissue injury without causing further injury. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Solicit the casualty's history. 
 2. Assess injury for underlying complications. 
 
a. Abrasions. 
 
(1) Depth of wound (relates to method of anesthesia and cleaning). 
 
(2) Amount of body surface (fluid loss can be significant in children). 
 
(3) Amount of contamination (precursor to infection). 
 
b. Contusions. 
 
(1) Underlying fracture. Forceful impact of objects creating injury can result in fractures. 
 
(2) Vascular involvement (extensive bleeding into tissue). 
 
(3) Check distal circulation. 
 
(4) Measure or mark the outline of the contusion. 
 
(5) Measure circumference of injured extremity, and compare measurement to uninjured 
extremity. 
 
(6) Neurological involvement. Test the sensation and movement of the injured part. Any 
signs of neurologic deficit may indicate a serious complication. 
 3. Initiate treatment for an abrasion. 
 
a. Principles of management are as follows: 
 
(1) Prevention of infection. 
 
(2) Promotion of rapid healing. 
 
(3) Prevention of "tattooing" from retained foreign bodies. 
 
b. Wound must be gently but thoroughly scrubbed with normal saline. 
 
c. Remove all foreign matter that cannot be scrubbed out by using a needle, No. 11 blade, 
or tissue forceps. 
 
d. Apply antibiotic ointment. 
 
e. Administer antibiotic therapy, if needed. Antibiotic therapy may be indicated for 
prophylaxis (consult medical officer). 
 
f. Give casualty instructions on wound care and signs and symptoms of infection. 
 
(1) Topical antibiotic ointment applied three or four times a day. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

3-73 
 
(2) Dressing changed every 2 to 3 days with gentle cleaning. 
 
(3) Monitor abrasion for signs and symptoms of infection. 
 4. Initiate treatment for a contusion. 
 
a. Ensure that there is no underlying fracture or evidence of any neurological or vascular 
involvement. 
 
b. Pad and splint injury, if needed. 
 
c. Manage complications appropriately (consult medical officer if question of underlying 
injury). 
 
(1) Apply splint or cast to fractures (following medical officer's recommendation). 
 
(2) Refer vascular or neurologic injury to a medical officer. 
 
d. Prescribe rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). 
 
(1) Wrap injured area with a roller bandage to compress the wound and slow bleeding 
into the tissue. 
 
(2) Apply ice to area over the wound. 
 
(3) If wound is significant, have casualty keep area elevated. 
 5. Record all treatment in the casualty's medical record on SF 600. 
Evaluation Preparation:

Perform a Needle Chest Decompression 
081-833-0075 
Conditions: You have a casualty with penetrating chest trauma with an occlusive dressing in 
place. You will need a 14 gauge, 3 1/4 inch needle catheter, povidone-iodine swab, alcohol 
swabs, tape 2 inches or greater, pen and a DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You 
have taken body substance isolation precautions and you are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform a needle chest decompression without causing unnecessary injury to the 
casualty. 
NOTE: Pneumothorax is defined as the presence of air within the pleural space. Air may enter 
the pleural cavity either from the lungs through a rupture, laceration, or from the outside through 
a sucking chest wound. Trapped air in the pleural space compresses the lung beneath it. 
Unrelieved pressure will push the contents of the mediastinum in the opposite direction, away 
from the side of the tension pneumothorax. This, in turn, will compromise venous return to the 
heart and interfere with respiration. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Verify the presence of a tension pneumothorax. 
NOTE: Any casualty with penetrating torso trauma with increased respiratory distress, will be 
treated as if he has a tension pneumothorax. 
 2. Locate the insertion site. Locate the second intercostal space (between the second and 
third ribs) at the midclavicular line (approximately in line with the nipple) on the affected side of 
the patient's chest. 
 3. Thoroughly cleanse a 3 to 4 inch area around the insertion site. Begin in the center and 
work outward using a circular motion. 
 4. Insert a 3 1/4 inch, 14 gauge needle over the top of the rib at a 90 degree angle to the 
chest wall, to the hub. 
 5. Remove the needle, leaving the catheter in place. 
 6. Stabilize the catheter hub to the chest with tape. 
 7. Place the casualty in a sitting position or in the recovery position with injured side down. 
 8. Record the treatment on theFMC. 
 9. Continue monitoring casualty by reassessment of reoccurrence of respiratory distress. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use a mannequin or have another Soldier act as the 
casualty. Under no circumstances will the needle be inserted. Have the Soldier demonstrate 
and explain what he would do.

Perform Extrication Using a Seated Device 
081-833-0096 
WARNING: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe BSI 
precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal standard of protection. 
Conditions: You will need to extricate a casualty with a suspected spinal injury using a seated 
device. All other life threatening injuries have been treated. Another Soldier is available to assist 
you. You both have performed a patient care hand wash, and taken body substance isolation 
(BSI) precautions. You will need a kendrick extrication device (KED), a rigid cervical collar, 
straps, padding, cravats, a long spine board, pen, and DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card 
(FMC). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform extrication using a seated device such as a KED for a casualty with a 
suspected spinal injury without causing further injury/harm. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Check for signs and symptoms of a spinal injury. 
NOTE: With unresponsive casualties, you should attempt to identify the mechanism of injury 
(MOI). 
WARNING: If you suspect the casualty has a spinal injury, you must treat them as though they 
have a spinal injury; when in doubt, immobilize. 
 
a. First you will want to minimize all movement of the spine. 
 
b. Instruct the responsive casualty to remain as still as possible. 
 
c. Instruct the responsive casualty to answer your questions with a verbal response only 
and not to shake or nod their head. 
 2. Instruct the second Soldier to establish and maintain manual inline stabilization of the 
casualty’s spine. 
 
a. Have your assistant properly position their hands. 
 
b. Keeping the casualty’s head in a neutral position and the nose in line with the casualty’s 
navel. 
 
c. Careful movement of the head and neck into a neutral position must be stopped if 
movement results in any of the following: 
 
(1) Neck muscle spasm. 
 
(2) Increased pain. 
 
(3) Increase in numbness, tingling, or loss of motor ability. 
 
(4) Compromise of the airway or ventilation. 
 
d. Instruct your assistant to continue manual stabilization until the casualty is secured to a 
long spine board. 
NOTE: Manual stabilization is a method of stabilization where the assistant firmly grasps the 
casualty’s head with both hands and attempts to keep it from moving. 
 
e. Be gentle when handling the extremities. 
 
f. If possible, inspect the spine for deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures or 
penetrations, burns, tenderness, lacerations, and swelling (DCAP-BTLS). 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-84 
 
3 May 2013 
NOTE: Do not move the casualty in an attempt to elicit a painful response. 
 
g. You can ask the responsive casualty where the pain is and/or palpate the spine with a 
gloved hand. 
 
h. Palpate for tenderness, instability, or crepitus (TIC) in the spinal region. 
NOTE: In addition to the normal components of your focused history and physical exam, try to 
pinpoint any pain or tenderness along the spine as best as you can. 
 3. Apply a rigid cervical collar. (See task 081-833-0177.) 
 4. Check circulation, sensation,and motor (CSM) function of all extremities. 
NOTE: Advise the casualty of what you are planning to do before moving the limb. 
 
a. Assess the radial pulse rate, quality, and rhythm. Check both radial pulses at the same 
time in order to compare one against the other. 
 
b. Assess pain response, light touch response, and grip response in both hands. 
 
(1) Ask casualty if they can tell you which finger you are touching or gently applying 
slight pressure to a finger. 
NOTE: Casualty is not allowed to look or move head, head must be maintained in neutral in line 
stabilization. 
 
(2) Place two or three of your gloved fingers into both of casualty’s hands and have them 
squeeze as hard as they can to check grip response. 
 
c. Assess pedal pulse on each foot at the same time in order to compare one against the 
other for quality and strength. 
WARNING: In some casualties it may be difficult to find pedal pulses in their feet. In cases like 
this, it is a good idea to also check capillary refill as a back-up to the pedal pulses. 
 
d. Assess plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of each foot. 
 
e. Ask casualty if they can tell you which toe you are touching. 
NOTE: Must remove casualty’s shoes in order to perform assessment of their feet. 
 5. Position the immobilization/KED behind the casualty and center it. 
NOTE: Before placing the KED behind the casualty, the two long straps leg straps/groin straps 
are unfastened and placed behind the device. 
 
a. Properly align the device. 
 
b. Wrap the vest around the casualty’s torso. 
 
c. Ensure that the device is tucked well up into the armpits. Adjust as necessary. 
 
d. Secure the chest/torso straps. Evaluate and adjust the straps as needed. 
NOTE: Chest/torso straps should not inhibit chest rise, resulting in respiratory compromise. 
NOTE: Chest/torso straps must be tight enough so the device does not move up, down, left, or 
right excessively, but not so tight as to restrict the casualty’s breathing. 
 
e. Secure the leg/groin straps. 
 
f. Secure the head to the device. 
 
(1) Apply appropriate padding behind the head to maintain proper alignment. 
 
(2) Apply velcro head straps. 
NOTE: Head immobilization straps should not allow excessive movement.

g. Secure the casualty’s wrist together and legs together using cravats. 
 6. Pivot the casualty onto the backboard/long spine board, while maintaining manual in-line 
neutral stabilization. 
 
a. Release groin straps once casualty is on backboard/long spine board. 
 
b. Secure casualty to backboard/long spine board. (See task 081-833-0181.) 
 7. Reassess CSM function of all extremities. 
 8. Record procedure and casualty’s tolerance of procedure on FMC. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier to act as the casualty. The Soldier 
being tested is to act as the team leader and direct the actions of the assistant. The casualty 
may be place in a vehicle or other confined space. Tell the casualty not to assist the Soldier in 
any way. Tell the assistant to only perform those actions the Soldier being evaluated directs. 
Brief Soldier: To test step 1, tell the Soldier to state the signs and symptoms of a spinal injury. 
Tell the Soldier that the casualty has a suspected spinal injury. Then tell the Soldier to apply the 
KED and position the casualty on a long spine board for transport.

Control Bleeding 
081-833-0124 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. In severe cases, you should wear gloves, eye protection, gown and shoe 
covers to protect yourself of splashes, projectile fluids, spurting fluids or splashes onto your 
clothing and foot wear. 
Conditions: You have a casualty who is bleeding externally. You will need field dressings, 
emergency bandages, gauze pads, gauze roller bandage, sterile dressing, kerlix, ace wraps, 
hemostatic bandage, combat application tourniquet (C-A-T), pen, and a DD Form 1380 US Field 
Medical Card (FMC). You have taken body substance isolation precautions and you are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Control bleeding without further harming the casualty. 
NOTE: If in a tactical environment, perform a combat casualty assessment. (See task 081-8330067.) 
Performance Steps 
 1. Determine if the bleeding is life threatening. If bleeding is life threatening, immediately apply 
a C-A-T. (See task 081-833-0065.) 
NOTE: The three methods of controlling external bleeding are direct pressure, hemostatic 
agents and tourniquet. 
 2. Apply direct pressure. 
 
a. Expose the wound. 
 
b. Place a sterile gauze or dressing over the injury site and apply fingertips, palm or entire 
surface of one hand and apply direct pressure for 3-5 minutes until bleeding is stopped. 
NOTE: If bleeding is profuse, apply direct pressure to the wound with your gloved hand initially 
while procuring a sterile dressing with your other hand. Larger wounds require a larger surface 
area of pressure and usually more pressure as well. Pack large, gaping wounds with sterile 
gauze and apply direct pressure. 
CAUTION: Once bleeding has been controlled, it is important to check a distal pulse to make 
sure that the dressing has not been applied too tightly. If a pulse is not palpable, adjust the 
dressing to re-establish circulation. 
 3. Apply a pressure dressing or emergency bandage if the wound continues to bleed. (See 
task 081-833-0212.) 
NOTE: If bleeding continues, go to step 4. 
CAUTION: In combat, while under enemy fire, a tourniquet is the primary means to control 
bleeding. It allows the individual, his battle buddy, or the combat medic to quickly control life 
threatening hemorrhage until the casualty can be moved away from the firefight. Always treat 
life threatening hemorrhage while you and the casualty are behind cover. 
 4. Apply a tourniquet if the wound continues to bleed. (See tasks 081-833-0065 and 081-8330066.) 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

3-91 
NOTE: If the source of the bleeding was due to a traumatic amputation, initiate treatment for an 
amputation. (See task 081-833-0061.) 
 5. Consider conjunctive therapies to control bleeding as necessary. 
 
a. Splinting. (See tasks 081-833-0263 and 081-833-0141.) 
 
b. Hemostatic bandage. (See task 081-833-0211.)

Initiate Treatment for an Open Abdominal Wound 
081-833-0028 
Conditions: You have a casualty with an open abdominal wound. All other more serious 
injuries have been assessed and treated. You will need field dressings, sterile abdominal 
dressings, cravats, scissors, gauze, saline solution, intravenous (IV) equipment, and DD Form 
1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Initiate treatment to an open abdominal wound, minimize the effects of the injury, 
and stabilize the casualty without causing additional injury. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Position the casualty. 
 
a. Place the casualty on his back (face up). 
 
b. Flex the casualty's knees. 
 
c. Turn the casualty's head to the side and keep the airway clear if vomiting occurs. 
WARNING: The most important concern in the initial management of abdominal injuries is 
shock. Shock may be present initially or develop later. Neither the presence or absence of a 
wound, nor the size of the external wound are safe guidelines for judging the severity of the 
wound. 
 2. Initiate treatment for shock. (See task 081-833-0047.) 
CAUTION: Do not attempt to replace protruding internal organs or remove any protruding 
foreign objects. 
 3. Expose the wound. Inspect for distention, contusions, penetration, eviscerations or obvious 
bleeding. 
 4. Stabilize any protruding objects. (See task 081-833-0029.) 
 5. Apply a sterile abdominal dressing. 
NOTE: Protruding abdominal organs should be kept moist to prevent the tissue from drying out. 
A moist, sterile dressing should be applied if available. 
 
a. Using the sterile side of the dressing, or other clean material, place any protruding 
organs near the wound. 
 
b. Ensure that the dressing is large enough to cover the entire mass of protruding organs or 
area of the wound. 
 
c. If large enough to cover the affected area, place the sterile side of the plastic wrapper 
directly over the wound. 
 
d. Place the dressing directly on top of the wound or plastic wrapper, if used. 
CAUTION: Do not apply pressure on the wound or expose internal parts. 
 
e. Tie the dressing tails loosely at the casualty's side. 
 
f. If two dressings are needed to cover a large wound, repeat steps 5a through 5e. Ensure 
that the ties of additional dressings are not tied over each other. 
 
g. If necessary, loosely cover the dressings with cravats. Tie them on the side of the 
casualty opposite that of the dressing ties. 
 6. Do not cause further injury to the casualty. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

Initiate Treatment for an Impaled Object 
081-833-0029 
WARNING: Do not exert any force on or attempt to remove the impaled object unless the object 
is impaled in the cheek and both ends of the object can be seen or unless the object is blocking 
the airway. Severe bleeding or nerve and muscle damage may result. 
Conditions: You have a casualty with an impalement injury. You will need field dressings, 
cravats, bandages, gauze, scissors, splinting equipment, sling, oxygen delivery device, pen and 
a DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You have managed all other immediate life 
threats, performed a patient care hand wash and are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Initiate treatment of the impalement, and minimize the effect of the injury without 
causing further injury to the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Position the casualty. 
 
a. Tell the casualty to remain still and not to move the impaled object. 
 
b. Expose the injury by cutting away or removing clothing or equipment around the wound 
site. 
 
c. If the impalement injury is on an extremity, check the pulse distal to the injury site. 
 
d. If the impalement is found in the cheek and both ends of the object can be seen. 
 
(1) Remove the object in the direction it entered the cheek. 
 
(2) Position the casualty to allow for drainage and be prepared to suction the casualty. 
 
e. If both ends of the object in the cheek cannot be seen, go to step 2. 
 2. Immobilize the impaled object. 
NOTE: If an assistant is available, one person should immobilize the object while the other 
applies the dressings and bandages. 
WARNING: Do not exert force on the impaled object. 
 
a. If necessary, apply direct pressure using gloved hands on either side of the object. 
 
b. Place several layers of bulky dressing around the injury site so that the dressings 
surround the object. 
 
c. Use additional bulky materials or dressings to build up the area around the object. 
 3. Apply the support bandages. 
 
a. Apply the bandage over the bulky support material to hold it in place. 
WARNING: Do not anchor the bandage on or exert pressure on the impaled object. 
 
b. Apply the bandage tightly but not so tight as to impair circulation or breathing. 
 
c. Check circulation after applying the support bandages. 
NOTE: If a pulse was palpated in step 1c and it cannot be palpated after the bandage has been 
applied, the bandage must be loosened until a pulse can be palpated. 
WARNING: Do not anchor a splint or sling to the impaled object. Avoid undue motion of the

Initiate Treatment for a Head Injury 
081-833-0038 
WARNING: Treat casualties with any type of traumatic head injury or loss of consciousness as 
if they have a spinal injury. (See task 081-833-0267.) 
Conditions: You have a casualty with a head injury. You will need field dressings, cravats, 
stethoscope, sphygmomanometer, cervical collar, oxygen tank set up, suction equipment, 
oropharyngeal airway, non-rebreather mask, pen and DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card 
(FMC). All other immediate life threats have been assessed and treated. You have performed a 
patient carehand wash and you are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Initiate treatment of the head injury and stabilize the casualty without causing 
additional injury. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Take appropriate body substance isolation (BSI) precautions. 
 2. Check for the signs and symptoms of head injuries. 
WARNING: Brain injury, leading to a loss of function or death, often occurs without evidence of 
a skull fracture or scalp injury. Because the skull cannot expand, swelling of the brain or a 
collection of fluid pressing on the brain can cause pressure. This can compress and destroy the 
brain tissue. 
 
a. Closed head injury--caused by a direct blow to the head. 
 
(1) Deformity of the head. 
 
(2) Clear fluid or blood escaping from the nose and/or ear(s). 
 
(3) Periorbital discoloration (raccoon eyes). 
 
(4) Bruising behind the ears, over the mastoid process (battle sign). 
 
(5) Lowered pulse rate if the casualty has not lost a significant amount of blood. 
 
(6) Signs of increased intracranial pressure. 
 
 
(a) Headache, nausea, and/or vomiting. 
 
 
(b) Possible unconsciousness. 
 
 
(c) Change in pupil size or symmetry. 
 
 
(d) Lateral loss of motor nerve function-one side of the body becomes paralyzed. 
NOTE: Lateral loss may not happen immediately but may occur later. 
 
 
(e) Change in the casualty's respiratory rate or pattern. 
 
 
(f) A steady rise in the systolic blood pressure if the casualty hasn't lost significant 
amounts of blood. 
 
 
(g) A rise in the pulse pressure (systolic pressure minus diastolic pressure). 
 
 
(h) Elevated body temperature. 
 
 
(i) Restlessness-indicates insufficient oxygenation of the brain. 
 
b. Concussion-caused by a violent jar or shock. 
NOTE: A direct blow to the skull may bruise the brain. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-99 
 
(1) Temporary unconsciousness followed by confusion. 
 
(2) Temporary, usually short term, loss of some or all brain functions. 
 
(3) The casualty has a headache or is seeing double. 
 
(4) The casualty may or may not have a skull fracture. 
 
c. Contusion-an internal bruise or injury. It is more serious than a concussion. The injured 
tissue may bleed or swell. Swelling may cause increased intracranial pressure that may result in 
a decreased level of consciousness and even death. 
 
d. Open head injury. 
 
(1) Penetrating wound-an entry wound with no exit wound. 
 
(2) Perforating wound-the wound has both entry and exit wounds. 
 
(3) Visibly deformed skull. 
 
(4) Exposed brain tissue. 
 
(5) Possible unconsciousness. 
 
(6) Paralysis or disability on one side of the body. 
 
(7) Change in pupil size. 
 
(8) Lacerated scalp tissue-may have extensive bleeding. 
 3. Direct manual stabilization of the casualty's head. 
 4. Assess the casualty's level of consciousness (LOC) by the following methods. 
 
a. AVPU Method. 
 
(1) Does the casualty know their name, date or time; location and events leading up to 
the injury, (Alert and oriented (A&O) x four)? 
 
(2) Does the casualty respond to verbal stimuli/commands? 
 
(3) Does the casualty respond to painful stimlus? 
 
(4) Is the casualty unconscious? 
 
b. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). 
NOTE: The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is calculated by using the best response noted 
while evaluating the casualty's eyes, verbal response and motor response. A baseline GCS 
should be calculated to assess the casualty's LOC accurately. The highest possible score a 
casualty can receive is 15 and the lowest possible score is 3. 
 
(1) Eye opening. 
 
(2) Verbal response. 
 
(3) Motor response. 
 5. Initiate treatment for the head injury. 
 
a. Superficial head injury. 
 
(1) Apply a dressing. 
 
(2) Observe for abnormal behavior or evidence of complications. 
 
b. Head injury involving trauma. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-100 
 
3 May 2013 
 
(1) Maintain a patent airway using the jaw thrust maneuver. (See task 081-831-0018.) 
 
(2) If the casualty is unconscious, insert an oropharyngeal airway without 
hyperextending the neck. (See task 081-833-0016.) 
 
(3) Administer high concentration oxygen by bag valve mask (see task 081-833-0158), if 
airway is not patent. If airway is patent, administer oxygen by non-rebreather mask. (See task 
081-833-0017.) 
 
(4) Observe the size of each pupil by shining a light in each eye to observe the pupillary 
reaction to the light. 
NOTE: The pupils should constrict promptly when exposed to bright light. Failure of the pupils to 
constrict may indicate brain injury. 
 
(5) Apply a cervical collar. (See task 081-833-0177.) 
 
(6) Dress the head wound(s). 
WARNING: Do not apply pressure to or replace exposed brain tissue. 
 
(7) Control bleeding. (See task 081-833-0124.) 
 
(8) Treat for shock. 
 
(9) Monitor the casualty for convulsions or seizures. (See task 081-831-0035.) 
 
(10) A casualty with no suspected c-spine injury can have the head elevated 6 inches to 
assist with drainage of blood from the brain. 
CAUTION: Do not give the casualty anything by mouth (NPO). 
 
(11) A casualty with a suspected c-spine injury should be placed on a long spine board. 
(See task 081-833-0181.) 
 6. Monitor unstable casualties every 5 minutes and document findings. 
 
a. Level of consciousness. 
 
b. Pupillary responsiveness and equality. 
 
c. Vital signs. 
 
d. Motor functions. 
 
(1) Evaluate the casualty's strength, mobility, coordination and sensation. 
 
(2) Document any complaints, weakness, or numbness. 
 7. Record the treatment on the FMC. 
 8. Evacuate the casualty. 
NOTE: Casualty should be facing you during transport. It is much easier to monitor and manage 
their airway if you can see it all times. Have suction readily available. (See task 081-833-0021.) 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the casualty. Use a moulage kit 
or similar materials to simulate a head wound. To test steps 2 and 7, coach the simulated 
casualty on how to answer the Soldier’s questions regarding such symptoms as headache. Tell 
the Soldier what signs, such as changes in pupil size, the casualty is exhibiting.

have been assessed and treated. You have performed a patient care handwash. You will need 
cotton-tipped swabs, clean cloth, sterile irrigation solution (normal saline, water, or other 
prescribed solution), bandages, dry sterile dressings, eye patch, a paper cup or cardboard cone, 
and DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Initiate treatment for foreign bodies of the eye, minimizing the effects of the injury 
and without causing additional injury to the eye. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Perform visual acuity testing. (See task 081-833-0193.) 
 2. Assess eyes: pupils, equal, round, reactive to light (PERRL). 
 3. Locate the foreign body. 
 
a. Method one. 
 
(1) Pull the lower lid down. 
 
(2) Tell the casualty to look up and to both sides and check for foreign bodies. 
 
(3) Pull the upper lid up. 
 
(4) Tell the casualty to look down and to both sides and check for foreign bodies. 
 
b. Method two. 
 
(1) Tell the casualty to look down. 
 
(2) Grasp the casualty's upper eyelashes and gently pull the eyelid away from the 
eyeball. 
 
(3) Place a cotton-tipped swab horizontally along the outer surface of the upper lid and 
fold the lid back over the swab. 
CAUTION: If the foreign bodies cannot be located, bandage both eyes and seek further medical 
aid immediately. 
 
(4) Look for the foreign bodies or damage on the globe. 
CAUTION: Do not put pressure on the globe. 
 4. Remove the foreign body. 
 
a. Small foreign body on an anterior surface. 
 
(1) Hold the casualty's eye open. 
 
(2) Irrigate the eye. (See task 081-833-0054.) 
 
b. Foreign body stuck to the cornea or lying under the upper or lower eyelid. 
 
(1) For a foreign body under the lower eyelid, pull the lower lid down. 
 
(2) For a foreign body under the upper eyelid, pull the upper lid up. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

treated all other immediate life threats, performed a patient care hand wash, taken appropriate 
body substance isolation precautions (BSI) and are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Initiate treatment of the casualty's burn according to the type and extent of the burn. 
Stabilize the casualty without causing further injury to the casualty or to self. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Determine the cause of the burns. 
 
a. Assess the scene. 
 
b. Question the casualty and/or bystanders. 
 
c. Determine if the casualty has been exposed to smoke, steam, or combustible products. 
 
d. Determine if the cause was open flame, hot liquid, chemicals, or electricity. 
 
e. Determine whether the casualty was struck by lightning. 
NOTE: If the burn was caused by an explosion or lightning, the casualty may also have been 
thrown some distance from the original spot of the incident. He may, therefore, have associated 
internal injuries, fractures, or spinal injuries. 
 2. Stop the burning process. 
 
a. Thermal burns. 
 
(1) Have the casualty STOP, DROP, and ROLL. 
 
 
(a) Do not permit the casualty to run, as this will fan the flames. 
 
 
(b) Do not permit the casualty to stand, as the flames may be inhaled or the hair 
ignited. 
 
 
(c) Place the casualty on the ground or floor and roll the casualty in a blanket or in 
dirt, and/or splash with water. 
 
(2) Remove all smoldering clothing and articles that retain heat, if possible. 
CAUTION: Do not remove clothing that is stuck to the burned area. If the clothing and skin are 
still hot, irrigate with copious amounts of room-temperature water or cover with a wet dressing, if 
available. 
 
(3) Cut away clothing to expose the burned area. 
 
b. Electrical burns. 
WARNING: Do not directly touch a casualty receiving a shock. To do so will conduct the current 
to you. 
 
(1) Turn off the current, if possible. 
WARNING: Electrical shock may cause the casualty to go into cardiac arrhythmia or arrest. 
Initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as appropriate. Casualties of lightening strikes may 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-110 
 
3 May 2013 
require prolonged CPR and extended respiratory support. 
 
(2) If necessary and/or possible, remove the electrical source from the casualty. 
WARNING: A chemical will burn as long as it is in contact with the skin. 
 
c. Chemical burns. 
 
(1) Flush the area of contact immediately with water. When flushing, be careful not to let 
the run off contaminate other areas of the body. Do not delay flushing by removing the 
casualty's clothing first. 
NOTE: If a solid chemical, such as lime, has been spilled on the casualty, brush it off before 
flushing. A dry chemical is activated by contact with water and will cause more damage to the 
skin. 
WARNING: Do not use a hard blast of water. Extreme water pressure can add mechanical 
injury to the skin. 
 
(2) Flush with cool water for 10 to15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing or 
other articles. 
NOTE: Flush longer for alkali burns because they penetrate deeper and cause more severe 
injury. 
Many chemicals have a delayed reaction. They will continue to cause injury even though the 
casualty no longer feels pain. 
 
d. White phosphorus burns. 
NOTE: White phosphorus (WP) will stick to the skin and continue to burn until it is deprived of 
air. WP burns are usually multiple and deep, usually producing second and third degree burns. 
 
(1) Deprive the WP of oxygen. 
 
 
(a) Splash with a nonpetroleum liquid (such as water, mud, or urine). 
 
 
(b) Submerge the entire area. 
 
 
(c) Cover the affected area with a moistened cloth, if available, or mud. 
 
(2) Remove the WP particles from the skin by brushing with a wet cloth or using forceps, 
stick, or knife. 
 3. Maintain an open airway, if necessary. (See task 081-831-0018.) 
NOTE: As long as 30 to 40 minutes may elapse before edema obstructs the airway and 
respiratory distress is noted. Always suspect an inhalation injury with a closed-space fire. 
 
a. Check for signs and symptoms of inhalation injury. 
 
(1) Facial burns. 
 
(2) Singed eyebrows, eyelashes, and/or nasal hairs. 
 
(3) Carbon deposits and/or redness in the mouth and/or oropharynx. 
 
(4) Sooty carbon deposits in the sputum. 
 
(5) Hoarseness, noisy inhalation, cough, or dyspnea. 
 
b. Check for signs and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. 
 
(1) Dizziness, nausea, and/or headache. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-111 
 
(2) Cherry-red colored skin and mucous membranes. 
 
(3) Tachycardia or tachypnea. 
 
(4) Respiratory distress or arrest. 
 
c. Administer humidified oxygen at a high flow rate. (See tasks 081-833-0018 and 081-8330158.) 
 4. Determine the percent of body surface area (BSA) burned. 
 
a. Cut the casualty's clothing away from the burned areas. 
 
b. Determine the percentage of BSA burned using the Rule of Nines. (See Figure 3-1.) 
 
Figure 3-1. Rule of Nines 
 5. Determine the degree of the burn. 
 
a. First degree. 
 
(1) Superficial skin only. 
 
(2) Red and painful, like a sunburn. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-112 
 
3 May 2013 
 
b. Second degree. 
 
(1) Partial thickness of the skin. 
 
(2) Penetrates the skin deeper than first degree. 
 
(3) Blisters and pain. 
 
(4) Some subcutaneous edema. 
 
c. Third degree. 
 
(1) Damage to or the destruction of a full thickness of skin. 
 
(2) Involves underlying muscles, bones, or other structures. 
 
(3) The skin may look leathery, dry, and discolored (charred, brown, or white). 
 
(4) Nerve ending destruction causes a lack of pain. 
 
(5) Massive fluid loss. 
 
(6) Clotted blood vessels may be visible under the burned skin. 
CAUTION: Check for entry and exit burns when treating electrical burns and lightning strikes. 
The amount of injured tissue in an electrical burn is usually far more extensive than the 
appearance of the wound would indicate. Although the burn wounds may be small, severe 
damage may occur to deeper tissues. (High voltage can destroy skin and muscles to such an 
extent that amputation may eventually be necessary.) 
 
(7) Subcutaneous fat may be visible. 
 6. Treat for shock those casualties who have second or third degree burns of 20% BSA or 
more. 
 
a. Initiate treatment for hypovolemic shock. (See task 081-833-0047.) 
 
b. Keep the casualty flat. 
 
c. Initiate an IV infusion. (See task 081-833-0033.) 
 
(1) Use ringer's lactate, if available. Normal saline is the second fluid of choice. 
CAUTION: Do not give more than 1,000 ml of Hextend® to a casualty. 
 
(2) If the casualty is in shock secondary to other injuries, IV may be started with 
Hextend. 
 
(3) Use a large gauge (#16 or #18) needle. 
 
(4) Initiate the IVs in an unburned area, if possible. 
 
(5) Use large peripheral veins. 
NOTE: The presence of overlying burned skin should not deter the use of an accessible vein. 
The upper extremities are preferable to lower extremities. 
 
d. Infuse fluids for a casualty based on Rule of Tens. 
NOTE: The objective is to determine an appropriate rate or amount of fluids to prevent 
hypovolemia after burn injury. Initiate fluid resuscitation as soon as intravenous/intraosseous 
(IV/IO) access is established. 
 
(1) Estimate the totoal body surface area (TBSA) burned to the nearest 10% (using the 
Rule of Nines or Rule of Palm). 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-113 
 
(2) Percentage TBSA (to the nearest 10%) x 10 ml/hr for adults weighing 88-176 
pounds. 
 
 
(a) Example: 170 pound male has burned approximately 30% of his body. 
 
 
(b) 30 (TBSA%) x 10 ml/hour = 300 ml/hour. 
 
(3) For every 25 pounds above 175, increase the initial rate by 100 ml/hour. 
 
 
(a) Example: A 195 pound male has burned approximately 50% of his TBSA. 
 
 
(b) 50 (TBSA%) x 10 ml/hour = 500 ml/hour + 100 ml/hour = 600 ml/hour. 
 
(4) Assess the circulatory blood volume. 
NOTE: Urine output is a reliable guide to assess circulating blood volume. 
 
 
(a) Measure the casualty's urine output in cc per hour. 
 
 
(b) Adjust the IV fluid flow to maintain 30 to 50 cc of urine output per hour. 
 7. Perform either an EMT Trauma Assessment or a Combat Casualty Assessment depending 
on the situation. (See tasks 081-833-0053, 081-833-0067.) 
 
a. Measure and record the casualty's vital signs. 
 
b. Assess the casualty for associated injuries. 
 
c. Check the distal circulation by checking pulses in all extremities. 
CAUTION: The swelling of burns on extremities can cause a tourniquet-like effect, and the 
swelling of a burned throat can impair breathing. 
 8. Remove potentially constricting items such as rings and bracelets. 
 9. Dress the burns. 
 
a. Apply a dry sterile dressing to the burns. 
 
b. Cover extensive burns with a sterile sheet, if available, or clean linen. 
 10. Record the treatment given on the FMC. 
 11. Evacuate the casualty. 
 12. Do not cause further injury to the patient. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the casualty. You may use a 
moulage kit or similar material to simulate burns on the casualty, or you may describe to the 
Soldier the area(s) of the body burned. Create a scenario which describes the cause and depth 
of the burns. For step 2, have the Soldier describe what actions should be taken to prevent 
further injury. To test step 5, describe the depth of the burns and have the Soldier tell you if they 
are first, second, or third degree. 
NOTE: When testing step 6, have the Soldier describe what actions should be taken when 
administering IV therapy, if necessary. When testing step 7, have the Soldier describe what 
action is taken. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to determine the extent of the casualty's burns and the treatment 
required.

Perform an EMT-B Trauma Assessment 
081-833-0053 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You encounter a casualty with multiple injuries. You will need sphygmomanometer, 
stethoscope, airway adjuncts, oxygen, non-rebreathing mask, cervical collar, long spine board, 
scoop stretcher, and DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Assess the casualty, identify all life-threatening injuries, and manage him 
appropriately without causing further injury to the casualty. Perform the assessment in the 
correct sequence. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Take BSI precautions. 
 2. Perform a Scene Size-Up. 
 
a. Determine the safest route to access the casualty. 
 
b. Determine the mechanism of injury (MOI). 
 
c. Determine the number of casualties. 
 
d. Request additional help, if necessary. 
 
e. Consider the need for spinal stabilization. 
NOTE: If the MOI is significant, direct another Soldier to provide manual, in-line stabilization of 
the cervical spine. 
 3. Perform an Initial Assessment. 
NOTE: Life threatening injuries should be managed as they are identified. 
a. Form a general impression (global overview) of the casualty's condition and environment. 
 
b. Determine the chief complaint. 
 
c. Assess the airway. 
(1) Perform appropriate maneuver to open and maintain the airway. (See task 081-8310018.) 
 
(2) Insert an appropriate airway adjunct, if necessary. (See tasks 081-833-0016, 081833-0142, and 081-833-0169. Also if skill level 30, See task 081-830-3016.) 
 
d. Assess breathing. 
 
(1) Determine the rate, depth and ease of respirations, (breathing). 
 
(2) Administer supplemental oxygen by non-rebreathing mask, if available. (See tasks

(4) Control bleeding. (See tasks 081-833-0161 and 081-833-0212.) 
 
(5) Treat for shock. (See task 081-833-0047.) 
 
f. Assess the casualty's mental status using the Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive (AVPU) 
scale. 
 
(1) A - Alert and oriented (eyes open spontaneously as you approach; casualty appears 
aware and responsive to the environment). 
 
(2) V - Responsive to verbal stimuli (sound). 
 
(3) P - Responsive to painful stimuli (touch, such as tapping the casualty on the shoulder 
or pinching the casualty's ear). 
 
(4) U - Unresponsive (does not respond to any stimuli). 
 
g. Determine casualty priority and make a transport decision. 
NOTE: High priority conditions that require immediate transport include a poor general 
impression, unresponsive, responsive but not following commands, difficulty breathing, shock, 
complicated childbirth, chest pain with systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg, 
uncontrolled bleeding, and severe pain. 
 4. If the MOI is significant, perform a Rapid Trauma Assessment. 
NOTE: A significant MOI includes ejection from a moving vehicle, death in the same passenger 
compartment, falls greater than 20 feet, rollover of vehicle, high-speed vehicle collision, vehiclepedestrian collision, motorcycle crash, trauma resulting in a loss of consciousness or altered 
mental status, and penetrations of the head, chest, abdomen (e.g., stab and gunshot wounds) 
or pelvis, and significant blunt trauma to the head, chest, abdomen, or pelvis. Additional 
significant MOI for a child include falls from more than 10 feet, bicycle collision, and vehicles in 
medium speed collision.

NOTE: The casualty must be "log rolled" to do this portion of the assessment. If necessary, the 
casualty should be placed on a long spine board after assessment. If the Pneumatic Anti-shock 
Garment (PASG) is deemed necessary, it should be positioned on the long spine board before 
casualty placement. If the casualty has a suspected pelvic fracture or bilateral femoral fractures, 
lift the casualty using a scoop stretcher, assess the posterior and place the casualty on the long 
spine board. 
 
(1) Inspect for DCAP-BTLS. 
NOTE: If penetrating wounds were noted during the anterior assessment, check for posterior 
exit wounds while the casualty is log-rolled/lifted with the scoop stretcher.

m. Manage secondary injuries and wounds appropriately. (See tasks 081-833-0045, 081833-0046, 081-833-0049, 081-833-0050, 081-833-0052, 081-833-0056, 081-833-0057, 081833-0058, 081-833-0060, 081-833-0062, 081-833-0064, 081-833-0154, and 081-833-3011.) 
 
n. Reassess the casualty's vital signs every 5 minutes (if unstable), every 15 minutes (if 
stable). 
 9. Document all assessment findings and care provided on the FMC. (See task 081-8310033.) 
Evaluation Preparation: 
For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the casualty or use a trauma 
mannequin. Describe a general scenario to the Soldier. The casualty must have more than one 
injury or condition. Wounds may be simulated using moulage or other available materials. A 
"conscious" casualty can be coached to show signs of such conditions as shock, and to respond 
to the Soldier's questions about the location of pain and other symptoms of injury. The evaluator 
will cue the Soldier during the assessment of an "unconscious" casualty as to whether the 
casualty is breathing, and describe such conditions as shock to the Soldier as they are making 
the checks. Tell the casualty not to assist the Soldier in any other way. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to tell you what action he would take for each wound or condition 
identified.

Apply an Improvised Tourniquet 
081-833-0066 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You have a casualty with life-threatening bleeding from an extremity. You will need 
tape, 2 inches or greater in width, 2 cravats, windlass (made with 8 tongue depressors taped 
together), pen, market, and DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Stop life-threatening hemorrhage with an improvised tourniquet within 90 seconds 
of encountering the casualty. 
NOTE: Prior to combat mission, prepare an improvised tourniquet with the following items: 8 
tongue depressors taped together, 1 cravat with a full nonslip knot centered and 1 cravat with a 
half knot. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Take BSI precautions. 
CAUTION: A tourniquet should be applied just proximal to the hemorrhaging wound. Leave the 
tourniquet in open view so it can be monitored for recurrent hemorrhage. Do not place an 
improvised tourniquet directly over a joint. 
 2. Expose the wound. 
 3. Place the prepared cravat and windlass 2-3 inches above the wound and secure the cravat 
tightly against the extremity with a full non-slip knot. 
CAUTION: A tourniquet should be applied tight enough to block arterial flow. 
 4. Twist the windlass until the bleeding stops.

Apply a Hemostatic Dressing 
081-833-0211 
Conditions: You have encountered a casualty who is bleeding externally. The wound is either 
not amenable to a tourniquet or a tourniquet is in place and alternate means of hemorrhage 
control are necessary. You will need a roll of combat gauze, cotton gauze (either wad or rolled) 
emergency bandage or elastic bandage, 3 inch tape, pen and DD Form 1380 US Field Medical 
Card (FMC). You have taken body substance isolation precautions and are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Apply a hemostatic dressing to control bleeding without causing further harm the 
casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Remove all clothing or equipment to obtain access to the wound. 
 2. Identify the point of bleeding within the wound. 
 
a. Remove any pooled blood from the wound cavity with your hand or a wad of cotton 
gauze. 
 
b. Locate the bleeding vessel(s). 
 3. Pack combat gauze directly over the source of bleeding. 
 4. Pack the wound with the entire dressing. More than one combat guaze may be required. 
 5. Apply direct pressure for 3 minutes. 
 
a. Periodically check the dressing to ensure proper placement and bleeding control. 
 
b. If the bandage becomes completely soaked through and there is still active bleeding, 
pack a second combat guaze into the wound. 
 6. Bandage wound to secure the dressing in place. 
 
a. If the wound cavity is deep, apply cotton gauze (either wad or rolled) over the dressing. 
 
b. Secure dressing in place with either an emergency bandage or an elastic bandage. 
 7. Secure the bandage in place with tape. 
 8. Document treatment on the FMC. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the casualty. Have a roll of 
combat gauze, cotton gauze (wad or rolled), an emergency bandage or elastic bandage, and 
tape. Tell the casualty not to assist the Soldier in any way. The bleeding may be from the 
extremity (upper or lower), axillary area, inguinal area or neck. Use a training package of 
combat gauze. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier the bleeding is bright red and spurting. The wound is not 
amendable to a tourniquet or a tourniquet is in place and alternate means of hemorrhage control 
is necessary; a hemostatic dressing is available. Tell the Soldier that they are not in a CBRN 
environment and to control the bleeding from the casualty's wound using the hemostatic 
dressing.

Apply a Pressure Dressing to an Open Wound 
081-833-0212 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You have encountered a casualty who is bleeding externally from an open wound. 
All other more serious injuries have been assessed and treated. You will need the casualty's 
emergency bandage, bandage scissors, and a DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). 
You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Apply a pressure dressing to control the bleeding without causing further harm to 
the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Fully expose the injury unless clothing is adhered to the wound. 
 2. Maintain direct (manual) pressure to limit the blood loss. 
 3. Apply the pressure dressing (casualty's emergency bandage). 
 
a. Open the plastic dressing package. 
 
b. Apply the dressing, white (sterile, non-adherent pad) side down, directly over the wound. 
 
c. Wrap the elastic tail (bandage) around the extremity and run the tail through the plastic 
pressure bar. 
 
d. Reverse the tail while applying pressure and continue to wrap the remainder of the tail 
around the extremity, continuing to apply pressure directly over the wound. 
 
e. Secure the plastic closure bar to the last turn of the wrap. 
WARNING: The emergency bandage must be loosened if the skin distal to the injury becomes 
cool, blue, numb, or pulseless. 
 
f. Check the emergency bandage to make sure that it is applied firmly enough to prevent 
slipping without causing a tourniquet-like effect. 
 4. Reassess the wound to ensure bleeding has been controlled and initiate treatment for 
hypovolemic shock, if necessary. (See task 081-833-0047.) 
 5. Record the treatment on the FMC. 
 6. Evacuate the casualty. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the casualty. Use moulage on 
the casualty's arm or leg to simulate the wound. Have an emergency bandage present. After the 
emergency bandage has been applied, tell the Soldier the bleeding has not been controlled. 
Once manual pressure and elevation have been applied, tell the Soldier the bleeding is now 
controlled. Tell the casualty not to assist the Soldier in any way. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier that they are not in a CBRN environment and to control the 
bleeding from a casualty's extremity.

Perform a Combat Casualty Assessment 
081-833-0067 
Conditions: You encounter a combat casualty under tactical conditions. You will need a 
combat medic aidbag, weapon, ballistic helmet, individual body armor, pen, an individual first 
aid kit (IFAK),four-sided occlusive dressing, 14 gauge 3 1/4 inch catheter-over-needle, 18 gauge 
1 1/4 inch intravenous (IV) needle, a saline lock, and a DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card 
(FMC). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform a combat casualty assessment to stabilize and prevent additional injuries 
to the casualty without endangering the mission. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Perform care under fire. 
NOTE: Care under fire is care rendered at the scene of the injury while the combat medic and 
the casualty are still under effective hostile fire. 
 
a. Return fire as directed before providing medical treatment. This may include wounded 
Soldiers still able to fight. 
 
b. Provide care to casualty tactically. 
 
(1) Suppress enemy fire. 
 
(2) Use cover or concealment (smoke). 
 
(3) If casualty is unresponsive, move casualty and his equipment to cover as the tactical 
situation permits. 
 
(4) Direct casualty to return fire, move to cover, and administer self-aid, (stop bleeding) if 
possible. If unable to move casualty to cover and still under direct enemy fire, tell the casualty 
not to move. 
 
(5) Keep the casualty from sustaining additional wounds. 
 
(6) Reassure the casualty. 
 
c. Administer only life-saving care while still under enemy fire. 
 
(1) Identify and control life-threatening hemorrhage with a tourniquet. 
 
(2) Cervical spine control is not necessary. 
NOTE: The combat medic rendering care decides treatment on the basis of the relative risk of 
further injury versus that of exsanguination. 
 
d. Communicate medical situation to team leader. 
 
e. Tactically transport casualty, his weapon, and mission-essential equipment to cover. 
 
f. Recheck bleeding control measures as the tactical situation permits. 
 2. Perform tactical field care. 
NOTE: Tactical field care is care rendered by the medic when no longer under effective hostile 
fire. Tactical field care also applies to situations in which an injury has occurred on a mission but 
there has been no hostile fire. Available medical equipment is limited to that carried into the field 
by the combat medic and mission personnel. 
 
a. In the following situations, communicate medical situation to patrol leader. 
 
(1) Upon determining that casualty will not be able to continue mission. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-128 
 
3 May 2013 
 
(2) Before initiating any medical procedures (ensure tactical situation allows for time 
required). 
 
(3) Upon any significant change in casualty's status. 
 
b. Note general impression of the casualty by determining responsiveness or level of 
consciousness (AVPU). 
 
(1) A - Alert. 
 
(2) V - Responds to verbal commands. 
 
(3) P - Responds to painful stimuli. 
 
(4) U - Unresponsive. 
NOTE: If the casualty has suffered from a blast or penetrating trauma and has no signs of life 
(no pulse, no blood pressure, no respirations), do not perform CPR. These casualties will not 
survive and you may expose yourself to enemy fire and delay care to other casualties. 
 
c. Assess and secure the airway. 
 
(1) If the casualty is conscious and not in respiratory distress, do not administer airway 
intervention. 
 
(2) If the casualty is unconscious, use a chin-lift or jaw-thrust to open the airway. Use a 
nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) to maintain the airway. 
 
(3) Roll the casualty into the recovery position. This allows for accumulated blood and 
mucus to drain and not choke the casualty. 
 
(4) For an unconscious casualty with an obstructed airway or severe maxillofacial 
trauma, perform a surgical cricothyroidotomy. (See task 081-833-3005.) 
 
d. Assess the chest and perform medical care to correct problems in breathing or 
respiration. 
 
(1) Immediately seal any penetrating injuries to the chest with a four-sided occlusive 
dressing, or apply a commercial device such as the Asherman®, Hyphen®, or Bolin® Chest 
Seals. 
 
(2) Monitor casualty for progressive severe respiratory distress (breathing becomes 
more labored and faster). 
 
(3) If respiration becomes progressively worse, consider this a tension pneumothorax 
and decompress affected chest side with a 14 gauge 3-1/4 inch catheter-over-needle inserted at 
second intercostal space (ICS) at midclavicular line (MCL). Secure the catheter in place with 
tape. 
 
e. Identify and control major bleeding not previously controlled. 
 
(1) Apply direct pressure and/or an emergency trauma bandage, as appropriate. 
 
(2) If a tourniquet was previously applied, consider changing the tourniquet to a pressure 
dressing and/or using a hemostatic bandage to control bleeding. 
 
(3) Leave the tourniquet in place while doing this. Loosen it, but do not remove it. 
 
(4) If the wound continues to bleed, retighten the tourniquet until bleeding stops. 
 
f. Determine if the casualty requires fluid resuscitation. 
 
(1) A palpable radial pulse and normal mental status should be used to determine who 
needs fluid resuscitation. These can be determined in the typical noisy and chaotic battlefield 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-129 
environment. Blood pressure measurement is not necessary. If a casualty has a radial pulse, his 
equivalent blood pressure is at least 80 mmHg. 
 
(2) If the casualty has a superficial wound, IV resuscitation is not necessary but oral fluid 
hydration should be encouraged. 
 
(3) If the casualty has a significant wound, either extremity or truncal (neck, chest, 
abdomen, or pelvis), and the casualty is coherent and has a palpable radial pulse: 
 
 
(a) Start an 18 gauge IV catheter and place a saline lock. Hold fluids but reevaluate 
as frequently as the tactical situation allows. If unable to start a peripheral IV, consider starting a 
F.A.S.T. 1 sternal intraosseous line. (See task 081-833-0185.) 
 
 
(b) Upper extremity is first choice. Do not start an IV on an extremity distal to a 
significant wound. 
 
 
(c) If the casualty does not have a radial pulse, ensure that the bleeding has stopped 
using whatever means available--direct pressure, pressure dressings, hemostatic bandage, or 
tourniquets as needed. 
 
 
(d) Once the bleeding has stopped, give 500 ml of Hextend® as rapidly as possible. 
Recheck in 30 minutes. If the radial pulse has returned, do not give any additional fluids but 
monitor as frequently as possible. 
 
 
(e) If the radial pulse does not return, give an additional 500 ml of Hextend®. 
 
 
(f) Recheck in 30 minutes. If the radial pulse returns, hold additional fluids and 
evacuate ASAP. If the radial pulse does not return, then triage your supplies and equipment to 
other casualties. 
 
g. Expose any wounds. 
 
(1) Remove the minimum amount of clothing required to expose and treat injuries. Dress 
the wounds to prevent contamination and help with hemostasis. An emergency bandage is ideal 
for this. Search for exit wounds. 
 
(2) Always check for exit wounds. 
 
(3) Protect the casualty against the environment. 
 
h. Splint obvious fractures. (See task 081-833-0263.) 
 
i. Administer pain medications as needed to any Soldier wounded in combat. 
 
(1) If the casualty is still able to fight, Mobic® 15 mg po qd with two 650 mg caplets of 
acetaminophen every 8 hours, will control mild to moderate pain and not cause drowsiness. 
These medications and an antibiotic make up the "Combat Pill Pack", and should be issued to 
each Soldier prior to deployment. 
 
(2) If the casualty is unable to fight-- 
 
 
(a) Morphine 5 mg given IV (through the saline lock) and repeated every 10 minutes 
as necessary is very effective in controlling severe pain. If a saline lock is used, it should be 
flushed with 5 ml of saline after the morphine administration. 
 
 
(b) Phenergan 25 mg IV or IM may be necessary to combat the nausea and vomiting 
associated with morphine. 
NOTE: Medics who carry morphine must be familiar with its side effects and trained in the use 
of Naloxone to counter these side effects. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-130 
 
3 May 2013 
 
 
(c) Pain relief can also be attained with the use of fentanyl transmucosal lozenges. 
These lozenges are placed between the cheek and gum and will be absorbed through the oral 
mucosa. This method allows for narcotic pain control without IV access. 
 
 
(d) Ensure there is visible evidence of the amount and time of pain medication given. 
 
(3) Soldiers should avoid aspirin and some of the older anti-inflammatory medications 
because of their detrimental effects on blood clotting. 
 
(4) Antibiotics should be considered in all Soldiers wounded in combat who have a 3 
hour delay in evacuation time since these wounds are prone to infection. 
 
 
(a) In Soldiers who are awake and alert, give an oral antibiotic. 
 
 
(b) In unconscious Soldiers or those who may not be able to take an oral antibiotic, IV 
antibiotics may be given through the saline lock every 12 hours. 
NOTE: Soldiers who may have allergies to these medications must be identified in the predeployment planning phase and alternate medications provided. 
 
j. Initiate medical evacuation request lines 1 through 5 (lines 6 through 9, as appropriate). 
 
k. Complete FMC. 
 
l. Transport the casualty to the site where evacuation is anticipated. 
 3. Perform combat casualty evacuation care (CASEVAC). Care in the CASEVAC phase does 
not differ significantly from the tactical field care phase. However, there are two significant 
differences. 
 
a. Additional medical personnel may accompany the evacuation asset to assist the medic. 
 
b. Additional medical supplies and equipment may also accompany the evacuation asset. 
This equip may consist of: 
 
(1) Oxygen. 
 
(2) Electronic monitoring devices. 
 
(3) Additional IV fluids. 
 
(4) Blood (may be available) 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: Give the Soldier a simulated casualty and a scenario in which he must perform a combat 
casualty assessment.

Apply a Cervical Collar 
081-833-0177 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: A casualty has received traumatic injuries and now complains of neck pain. All 
immediate life threats have been assessed and treated. Another Soldier is available to assist 
you. You will need a rigid cervical collar device and head supports. You are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Complete all the steps necessary to apply a cervical collar to a casualty with a 
suspected cervical spine injury without causing additional injury to the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. While your assistant is stabilizing the casualty's cervical spine, complete an initial 
assessment and care for all life-threatening injuries before applying the cervical collar. 
WARNING: If you suspect the casualty has a spinal injury, treat him as though he has a spinal 
injury. 
 2. Use the mechanism of injury, level of responsiveness, and location of injuries to determine 
the need for cervical immobilization. 
 3. While maintaining manual cervical spine stabilization and neutral neck alignment, assess 
the casualty's neck prior to placing the collar. Once the collar is in place, you will not be able to 
assess or palpate the back of the neck. 
 4. Reassure the casualty and explain the procedure to him. 
 5. Determine the size of collar to apply. 
 
a. The front height of the collar should fit between the point of the chin and the chest at the 
suprasternal notch. 
 
b. Once in place, the collar should rest on the shoulder girdle and provide firm support 
under both sides of the mandible without obstructing the airway or any ventilation efforts. 
 
c. If the collar is too large, the casualty's neck may be placed in hyperextension. 
 
d. If the collar is too small, the casualty's neck may be placed in hyperflexion. 
 6. Apply the collar to a seated casualty, if applicable. 
 
a. Have the other Soldier apply in-line stabilization of the head and neck from behind the 
casualty. 
 
b. Place the chin support first. 
 
c. Wrap the collar around the neck. 
 
d. Secure the Velcro® strap in place. 
 
e. Maintain manual stabilization of the head and neck until the casualty is immobilized on a 
long spine board. 
NOTE: Cervical collars do not fully immobilize the cervical spine; therefore, you must maintain 
manual stabilization of the casualty's neck until the casualty is fully immobilized on a long spine 
board. (See task 081-833-0181.) 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

 7. Apply the collar to a supine casualty, if applicable. 
 
a. Have the other Soldier kneel at the casualty's head and manually apply in-line 
stabilization of the head and neck. 
 
b. Set the collar in place around the neck. 
 
c. Secure the Velcro strap in place. 
 
d. Maintain manual stabilization of the head and neck until the casualty is immobilized on a 
long spine board. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the casualty. You will need 
another Soldier to act as an assistant. The Soldier being tested is to act as the team leader and 
direct the actions of the assistant. The casualty may be placed in a vehicle or other scenario, 
depending on the available resources and the technique you are testing. Tell the casualty not to 
assist the Soldiers in any way. Tell the assisting Soldier to only perform those actions the 
Soldier being evaluated directs. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to state the signs and symptoms of a spinal injury. Tell the Soldier 
that the casualty has a suspected cervical injury. Then tell the Soldier to apply a cervical collar 
and to direct the actions of the assistant.

Apply a Long Spine Board 
081-833-0181 
Conditions: You have determined that your casualty needs a long spine board. All immediate 
life threats have been treated. Three or four Soldiers are available for assistance. You will need 
straps, cravats, towels, long spine boards, safety pins, materials to improvise a cervical collar 
and head supports, and DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Complete all the steps necessary to immobilize and transport a casualty with a 
suspected spine injury on a long spine board, without causing additional injury to the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
WARNING: If you suspect that the casualty has a spinal injury, treat him as though he does 
have a spinal injury. 
 1. Check for the signs and symptoms of a spinal injury. 
 
a. Spinal deformity. Its presence indicates a severe spinal injury, but its absence does not 
rule one out. 
 
b. Tenderness and/or pain in the spinal region. 
 
(1) Detect it by palpation or ask the casualty. 
 
(2) The presence of any pain is sufficient cause to suspect the presence of a spinal 
injury. 
 
c. Lacerations and/or contusions in the spinal region indicate severe trauma and usually 
accompany a spinal injury. 
NOTE: The absence of lacerations and/or contusions does not rule out a spinal injury. 
 
d. Weakness, loss of sensation, and/or paralysis. 
 
(1) A neck level (cervical) spine injury may cause numbness or paralysis in all four 
extremities. 
 
(2) A waist level spinal injury may cause numbness or paralysis below the waist. 
 
(3) Ask the casualty to try to move the fingers and toes to check for paralysis. 
 2. Place the casualty on a long spine board. 
NOTE: If a spine board is not available, utilize a standard litter or improvised litter made from a 
board or door. A hard surface is preferable to one that gives with the casualty's weight. 
 
a. The log roll technique. 
 
(1) Place the spine board next to, and parallel with, the casualty. 
 
(2) Immobilize the casualty's head and neck using manual stabilization. 
 
 
(a) Place your hands on both sides of the casualty's head, cradling the skull with your 
hands. 
 
 
(b) Maintain manual stabilization until the casualty has been secured on the spine 
board. 
 
(3) Apply a cervical collar, if available, or improvise one. (See task 081-833-0177.) 
 
(4) Brief each of the three assistants on their duties and instruct them to kneel on the 
same side of the casualty, with the spine board on the opposite side of the casualty. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-134 
 
3 May 2013 
 
 
(a) First assistant. Place the near hand on the shoulder and the far hand on the waist. 
 
 
(b) Second assistant. Place the near hand on the hip and the far hand on the thigh. 
 
 
(c) Third assistant. Place the near hand on the knee and the far hand on the ankle. 
 
(5) On your command, and in unison, the assistants roll the casualty slightly toward 
them. Turn the casualty's head, keeping it in a straight line with the spine. 
 
(6) Instruct the assistants to reach across the casualty with one hand, grasp the spine 
board at its closest edge, and slide it against the casualty. Instruct the second assistant to reach 
across the board to the far edge and hold it in place to prevent board movement. 
 
(7) Instruct the assistants to slowly roll the casualty back onto the board. Keep the head 
and spine in a straight line. 
 
(8) Place the casualty's wrists together at the waist and tie them together loosely. 
NOTE: If the cervical collar or improvised collar does not fit flush with the spine board, place a 
roll in the hollow space between the neck and board. The roll should only be large enough to fill 
the gap, not to exert pressure on the neck. 
 
b. The straddle-slide technique. 
NOTE: Use this method when limited space makes it impossible to use the log roll technique 
(such as fractured pelvis). 
 
(1) Stand at the head of the casualty with your feet wide apart. 
 
(2) Apply stabilization to the casualty's head and apply a cervical collar. 
 
(3) Instruct the first assistant to stand behind you (facing your back), to line up the spine 
board, and to gently push the spine board under the casualty at your command. 
 
(4) Instruct the second assistant to straddle the casualty while facing you and gently 
elevate the shoulders so that the spine board can be slid under them. 
 
(5) Instruct the third assistant (facing you) to carefully elevate the hips while the spine 
board is being slid under the casualty. 
WARNING: Complete all movements simultaneously, keeping the head and spine in a straight 
line. 
NOTE: If the cervical collar or improvised collar does not fit flush with the spine board, place a 
roll in the hollow space between the neck and board. The roll should only be large enough to fill 
the gap, not to exert pressure on the neck. 
 
(6) Instruct the fourth assistant (facing you) to carefully elevate the legs and ankles while 
the board is being slid into place under the casualty. 
 3. Secure the casualty to the long spine board. 
 
a. Secure the casualty's torso and lower extremities with straps across the chest, hips, 
thighs, and lower legs. 
NOTE: Include the arms if the straps are long enough. If the spine board is not provided with 
straps and fasteners, use cravats or other long strips of cloth. 
 
WARNING: Do not release manual stabilization until the cravats or head straps are firmly in 
place.

b. Secure the casualty's head and head supports to the board with straps or cravats. 
 
(1) Apply head supports. 
 
(2) Use two rolled towels, blankets, boots, or similar material. (Do not use sandbags.) 
 
(3) Place one close to each side of the head. 
 
(4) Using a cravat-like material across the forehead, make the supports and head one 
unit by tying to the board. 
 4. Record the treatment on the FMC. 
 5. Evacuate the casualty. 
 6. Do not cause further injury to the casualty. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the casualty. You will need three 
or four Soldiers to act as the assistants. The Soldier being tested is to act as the team leader 
and direct the actions of the assistants. The casualty may be placed in a vehicle or other 
scenario, depending on available resources and the technique you are testing. Tell the casualty 
not to assist the Soldiers in any way. 
Brief Soldier: To test step 1, tell the Soldier to state the signs and symptoms of a spinal injury. 
Tell the Soldier that the casualty has a suspected spinal injury. Then tell the Soldier to position 
the casualty on a spine board and to direct the actions of the assistants.

Subject Area 4: Airway Management 
Set Up an Oxygen Tank 
081-833-0098 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You need to set up an oxygen tank. You have already performed a patient care 
handwash. You will need a full oxygen cylinder with a regulator/flow meter, non-sparking 
cylinder wrench, oxygen regulator/flow meter for D cylinders, yoke attachment, humidifier, sterile 
water, oxygen cylinder transport carrier and/or stand oxygen, oxygen administration device, and 
warning signs. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Set up the oxygen tank without violating safety precautions or endangering patients 
or yourself. 
NOTE: Most of pre-hospital care, oxygen is given with a D sized oxygen cylinder. This task is 
written for a D sized oxygen cylinder. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Obtain the necessary equipment. 
CAUTION: Always ensure that the cylinder selected contains oxygen and not some other 
compressed gas. United States oxygen cylinders are color coded green, silver or chrome with a 
green area around the valve stem on top. The international code is white. 
 
a. Oxygen cylinder. (See Figure 3-2.) 
NOTE: Check the oxygen cylinder tag to determine whether the tank is "FULL", "IN USE" 
(partially full), or "EMPTY". (See Figure 3-2a.)

Figure 3-2a. Oxygen cylinder tag 
 
 
b. Cylinder with regulator/flowmeter. (See Figure 3-3.) 
NOTE: When the cylinder regulator pressure gauge reads 200 psi or lower, the oxygen tank is 
considered empty. 
The pressure-compensated flowmeter is affected by gravity and must be maintained in an 
upright position. The Bourdon gauge flowmeter is not affected by gravity and can be used in any 
position.

d. Sterile water. 
 
e. Non-sparking cylinder wrench. 
 
f. Oxygen cylinder transport carrier and/or stand. 
 
g. Oxygen administration device appropriate for the patient or as ordered by the medical 
officer (nasal cannula, non-rebreather mask, or BVM device with reservoir). 
 
h. Warning signs. 
 
(1) "NO SMOKING". 
CAUTION: Because of the extreme pressure in oxygen tanks, they should be handled with 
great care. Do not allow tanks to be banged together, dropped, or knocked over. 
 
(2) "OXYGEN IN USE". 
 2. Secure the oxygen cylinder. 
 
a. Upright position or IAW local SOP. 
 
b. Secured with straps or in a stand. 
 
c. Away from doors and areas of high traffic. 
 3. Remove the cylinder valve cap. 
NOTE: The cylinder valve cap may be noisy or difficult to remove; however, the threads of the 
cylinder cap should never be oiled. 
 4. Use either the hand wheel or a non-sparking wrench to "crack" (slowly open and quickly 
close) the cylinder to flush out any debris. 
 5. Attach the regulator/flowmeter to the cylinder. 
 
a. Locate the three holes on the oxygen cylinder stem and ensure that an "O" ring is 
present. (See Figure 3-4.) 
NOTE: If the "O" ring is not present, an oxygen leak will occur. 
 
Figure 3-4. York regulator (stem) 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

3-139 
 
b. Examine the yoke attachment and locate the three corresponding pins on the yoke 
attachment. (See Figure 3-5.) 
NOTE: The compressed gas industry uses a "pin-indexing system" for portable gas cylinders. 
The locations of the pins on the yoke match only the regulator/flowmeter for an oxygen cylinder. 
 
Figure 3-5. Yoke Regulator 
 
c. Slide the yoke attachment over the cylinder stem, ensuring that the pins are seated in the 
proper holes. 
 
d. Turn the vise-like screw on the side of the yoke attachment to secure it. 
 
e. Open the valve to test for leaks, and then close it. 
NOTE: If there is a leak, check the regulator connection and obtain a new regulator/flowmeter 
and/or cylinder, if necessary. When in-wall oxygen is available, it will be attached to the oxygen 
outlet as follows: a. Turn the flow adjusting valve of the flowmeter to the OFF position. b. Insert 
the flowmeter adapter into the opening outlet and press until a firm connection is made. 
 6. Fill the humidifier bottle to the level indicated (about two-thirds full) with sterile water. 
 7. Attach the humidifier to the flowmeter. 
NOTE: If an oxygen tube connector adapter is present, remove it from the flowmeter by turning 
the wing nut. 
 
a. Attach the humidifier to the flowmeter with the wing nut on the humidifier. 
NOTE: Not all humidifiers have "wing" style nuts. Some have regular "bolt" style nuts. 
 
b. Secure the nut by hand-tightening it. 
NOTE: Humidifiers and tubing should be changed at least once every 24 hours (or more often 
IAW local SOP). 
 
CAUTION: "OXYGEN" and "NO SMOKING" signs should be posted in the areas where oxygen 
is in use or stored. 
 8. Post warning signs. 
 9. Report and/or record completion of the procedure.

Insert a Nasopharyngeal Airway 
081-833-0142 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You encounter a casualty with a reduced level of consciousness who requires an 
airway adjunct. The casualty has a gag reflex with no evidence of head injury or head trauma. 
You will need disposable gloves (latex free), a nasopharyngeal airway (NPA), water-based 
lubricant and a DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You have performed a patient 
care handwash, taken body substance isolation precautions and are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Insert a nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) without causing injury to the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
CAUTION: Do not use the nasopharyngeal airway if there is clear fluid (cerebrospinal fluid- 
CSF) coming from the ears or nose. This may indicate a skull fracture. 
 1. Place the casualty supine with the head in a neutral position. 
 2. Select the appropriate size of airway using one of the following methods: 
 
a. Measure the airway from the patient's nostril to the earlobe. 
 
b. Measure the airway from the patient's nostril to the angle of the jaw. 
NOTE: Choosing the proper length ensures appropriate diameter. Standard adults sizes are 34, 
32, 30, and 28 French. 
CAUTION: Do not use a petroleum-based or non-water-based lubricant. These substances can 
cause damage to the tissues lining the nasal cavity and pharynx thus increasing the risk for 
infection. 
 3. Lubricate the tube with a water-based lubricant. 
 4. Insert the airway. 
 
a. Push the tip of the nose upward gently. 
 
b. Position the tube so that the bevel of the airway faces toward the septum. 
NOTE: Most nasopharyngeal airways are designed to be placed in the right nostril. 
CAUTION: Never force the airway into the patient's nostril. If resistance is met, pull the tube out 
and attempt to insert it in the other nostril. 
 
c. Insert the airway into the nostril and advance it until the flange rests against the nostril. 
 5. Place the patient in the recovery (lateral recumbent, coma) position to prevent aspiration of 
blood, mucus, or vomitus. 
 6. Record the procedure on the FMC. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use a simulation device capable of accepting a 
nasopharyngeal airway device. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier the simulated patient requires an NPA to be inserted.

Perform Endotracheal Suctioning 
081-833-0170 
Conditions: You have a patient that requires endotracheal suctioning. You will need suction 
unit, suction catheter, sterile basin, sterile water, sterile gloves, or a disposable suction kit. You 
have performed a patient care handwash. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform endotracheal suctioning without violating aseptic technique or causing 
injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
 2. Position the patient in the semi-Fowler's position. 
NOTE: In some cases, such as spinal injuries, the patient will have to remain in whatever 
position he is in at the time. 
 
WARNING: If the suction pressure is too low, the secretions cannot be removed. If the pressure 
is too high, the mucous membranes may be forcefully pulled into the catheter opening. 
 3. Check the pressure on the suction apparatus. 
NOTE: Ensure that the pressure reading is within the limits specified by local SOP and the 
recommendations of the equipment manufacturer. 
 4. Prepare the sterile materials. (See task 081-833-0007.) 
CAUTION: Monitor the pulse oximeter reading during the entire procedure. (See task 081-8330164.) 
 5. Pre-oxygenate the patient. 
NOTE: The goal of pre-oxygenation is to maintain pulse oximetry (SPO2) at or above 95%. 
 6. Put on sterile gloves. (See task 081-831-0008.) 
 7. Remove the catheter from the package using the dominant hand, keeping the catheter 
coiled to prevent contamination. 
NOTE: This hand must remain sterile. 
CAUTION: Do not touch the patient while measuring the length of the catheter. This will violate 
aseptic technique. 
 8. Measure the length of the suction catheter so that it will be approximately at the carina. 
 
a. Tip of catheter to the ear. 
 
b. From the ear to the nipple line. 
 9. Attach the tubing to the catheter with the non-dominant hand. 
NOTE: This hand does not have to remain sterile. 
 10. Test the patency of the catheter. 
 
a. Turn the suction unit on with the non-sterile hand. 
 
b. Insert the catheter tip into the sterile saline solution using the sterile hand. 
 
c. Place the non-sterile thumb over the suction port to create suction. Observe the saline 
entering the drainage bottle.

NOTE: If no saline enters the bottle, check the suction unit and/or replace the catheter and 
retest for patency. 
 11. Suction the patient. 
 
a. Remove the oxygen delivery device with the non-dominant hand. 
 
b. Lubricate the catheter tip by dipping it into the saline solution. 
 
c. Gently insert the catheter into the airway to the measured length without suctioning. 
CAUTION: Do not suction any longer than 15 seconds. 
 
d. Apply intermittent suction by placing and releasing the non-dominant hand over the vent 
of the catheter while withdrawing the catheter. 
 
e. Replace the oxygen delivery device and re-oxygenate the patient. 
 
f. Repeat steps 10a through 10e as necessary, allowing time for re-oxygenation to take 
place between procedures. 
WARNING: Discontinue suctioning immediately if changes in color or pulse rate occur. 
 12. Observe the patient for hypoxemia. 
 13. Disconnect the catheter and remove the gloves. 
NOTE: Discard items IAW local SOP. 
 14. Make the patient comfortable. 
 15. Discard, or clean and store, used items IAW local SOP. 
 16. Record the procedure on the appropriate form. 
 
a. Respirations (rate and breath sounds before and after suctioning). 
 
b. Type, amount and color of secretions. 
 
c. Patient's toleration of the procedure. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use a mannequin to be the simulated patient.

Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: Place a CPR mannequin or another Soldier acting as the patient, face down on the 
ground. For training and evaluation, you may specify to the Soldier whether the patient has a 
spinal injury to test step 2, or you may create a scenario in which the patient's condition will 
dictate to the Soldier how to treat the patient. After step 3 tell the Soldier whether the patient is 
breathing or not and ask what should be done. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to open the patient's airway.

Clear an Upper Airway Obstruction 
081-831-0019 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You are evaluating a casualty who is not breathing or is having difficulty breathing, 
and you suspect the presence of an upper airway obstruction. You have performed a patient 
care hand wash, taken appropriate body isolation precautions and are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Complete, in order, all the steps necessary to clear an object from a casualty's 
upper airway. Continue the procedure until the casualty is able to speak and breathe normally or 
until relieved by a qualified person. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Determine whether the casualty needs your assistance. 
 2. If the casualty is lying down, bring him to a sitting or standing position. 
 3. Apply abdominal or chest thrusts. 
NOTE: Use abdominal thrusts unless the casualty is in the advanced stages of pregnancy, is 
very obese, or has a significant abdominal wound. 
 
a. Abdominal thrusts. 
 
(1) Stand behind the casualty and wrap your arms around his waist. 
 
(2) Make a fist with one hand and place the thumb side of your fist against the casualty's 
abdomen in the midline, slightly above the navel and well below the tip of the xiphoid process. 
 
(3) Grasp your fist with your other hand and press your fist into the casualty's abdomen 
with quick inward and upward thrusts. 
 
(4) Continue abdominal thrusts until the blockage is expelled or the casualty becomes 
unconscious. 
NOTE: Make each thrust a separate, distinct movement given with the intent of relieving the 
obstruction. 
 
b. Chest thrusts. 
 
(1) Stand behind the casualty and encircle his chest with your arms just under the 
armpits. 
 
(2) Make a fist with one hand and place the thumb side of the fist against the middle of 
the casualty's sternum. 
 
(3) Grasp your fist with your other hand and give backward thrusts, pressing your fist into 
the casualty's chest. 
CAUTION: Do not position your hand on the xiphoid process or the lower margins on the rib 
cage. 
 
(4) Continue giving thrusts until the blockage is expelled or the casualty becomes 
unconscious. 
NOTE: Administer each thrust with the intent of relieving the obstruction. If the casualty 
becomes unconscious, position the casualty on his back, open the airway. (See task 081-8310018.) Observe the airway to look for the obstruction, and begin the steps of cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR). 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-151 
 4. Take appropriate action if the casualty becomes unconscious. Begin the steps of CPR. 
 
a. Determine unresponsiveness. 
 
b. Open the airway. 
NOTE: Perform the head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver to clear an obstruction that is caused by the 
tongue and throat muscles relaxing back into the airway in any person who is found 
unconscious. 
 
c. Observe the airway to look for the obstruction. 
NOTE: If the obstruction is visible, you may attempt to remove the object. 
 
d. Attempt ventilation. 
 
e. If the first ventilation does not produce visible chest rise, reposition the head and 
reattempt to ventilate. 
 
f. If both breaths fail to produce visible chest rise, perform 30 chest compressions and then 
open the airway and look into the mouth for the obstruction. 
 
g. Reattempt ventilation. 
 5. When the object is dislodged, check for breathing. Perform rescue breathing, if necessary 
(see task 081-831-0048) or continue to evaluate the casualty for other injuries. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: You will need another Soldier to play the part of the casualty. Instruct the casualty how to 
appear as though he has an obstructed airway; with consciousness progressing to 
unconsciousness. Instruct the casualty not to assist the Soldier in any way. 
Brief Soldier: Describe the signs and symptoms of a casualty with good air exchange, poor air 
exchange, or a complete airway obstruction. Ask the Soldier what should be done and score 
step 1 based on the answer. Then tell the Soldier to clear an upper airway obstruction. Tell the 
Soldier to demonstrate how to position the casualty, where to stand and how to position his/her 
hands for the thrusts. The Soldier must tell you how they should be done and how many thrusts 
should be performed. Ensure that the Soldier understands that he/she must not actually perform 
the thrusts. After completion of step 5, ask the Soldier what must be done if the casualty 
becomes unconscious.

Perform Rescue Breathing 
081-831-0048 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You have a casualty who is unconscious and not breathing. You must perform 
rescue breathing. You will need a bag-valve-mask (BVM) system or flow-restricted oxygenpowered ventilation device (FROPVD), airway adjuncts, supplemental oxygen (O2), and pocket 
mask with one way valve. You have taken BSI (body substance isolation) precautions, and you 
are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Complete in order all the steps necessary to restore breathing. Continue the 
procedure until the casualty starts to breathe; you are relieved by another qualified person or 
medical officer, are not required to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or are too 
exhausted to continue. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Position yourself at the side or directly above the casualty's head. 
 2. Open the airway. (See task 081-831-0018.) 
 
a. Use the head-tilt/chin-lift maneuver when there is no suspected spinal injury. 
WARNING: Foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO) such as those caused by food or small 
objects are difficult to see and can cause both partial and complete airway obstructions. 
 
b. Use the jaw thrust maneuver when trauma is observed or there is a suspected spinal 
injury. 
NOTE: Several factors can make it difficult to establish a patent airway such as trauma to the 
face that causes swelling and bleeding that will make it difficult to keep the airway clear. 
 3. Ventilate the casualty using the mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-nose, mouth-to-mask, BVM 
system, or flow-restricted oxygen-powered ventilation device FROPVD, as appropriate. 
 
a. Mouth-to-mouth method. 
 
(1) Maintain the chin-lift while pinching the nostrils closed using the thumb and index 
fingers of your hand on the casualty's forehead. 
 
(2) Take a regular breath and make an airtight seal around the casualty's mouth with 
your mouth. 
 
(3) Give one slow breath (lasting one second) into the casualty's mouth, watching for the 
chest to rise and fall and listening and feeling for air to escape during exhalation. 
NOTE: You must let go of the casualty's nose once you have given the breath and you are 
watching for the rise and fall of their chest, in order to feel the air escape upon your cheek. 
 
(4) If the chest rises and air escapes: 
 
 
(a) Give a second slow breath. 
 
 
(b) Go to step 6 (Check carotid pulse). 
 
(5) If the chest does not rise or air does not escape, go to step 4 (reposition head). 
 
b. Mouth-to-nose method. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-153 
NOTE: The mouth-to-nose method is recommended when you cannot open the casualty's 
mouth, there are jaw or mouth injuries, or you cannot maintain a tight seal around the casualty's 
mouth. 
 
(1) Maintain the head-tilt with the hand on the forehead while using the other hand to lift 
the casualty's jaw and close the mouth. 
 
(2) Take a regular breath and make an airtight seal around the casualty's nose with your 
mouth. 
 
(3) Blow one full breath (lasting one second) into the casualty's nose while watching for 
the chest to rise and fall and listening and feeling for air to escape during exhalation. 
NOTE: It may be necessary to open the casualty's mouth or separate the lips to allow air to 
escape. 
 
(4) If the chest rises: 
 
 
(a) Give a second full breath. 
 
 
(b) Go to step 6. 
 
(5) If the chest does not rise, go to step 4. 
 
c. Mouth-to-mask. 
NOTE: The face mask is an important part of infection control to the rescuer. Rescuer breaths 
are delivered to the casualty through the one-way valve of the mask. There is no direct contact 
with the casualty's mouth. 
NOTE: Kneel above the casualty's head to perform this. 
 
(1) Insert an appropriate airway adjunct. 
 
(2) Connect the mask to an appropriate oxygen source, if available, at a flow rate of 15 
liters per minute (lpm). 
 
(3) Place the mask over the casualty's face, beginning at the top of the nose and walking 
the mask down so that it rests just below the lower lip. 
 
(4) Using both hands, form a tight seal between the mask and the casualty's face while 
maintaining a head tilt or jaw thrust. 
 
(5) Take a regular breath and exhale into the mask. 
 
 
(a) If the breath goes in, give a second breath and go to step 6. 
 
 
(b) If the breath fails to go in, go to step 4. 
 
d. BVM system. 
NOTE: Kneel above the casualty's head to perform this. 
 
(1) Insert an appropriate airway adjunct. 
 
(2) Connect BVM to oxygen at 15 lpm if available. 
 
(3) Position the mask on the casualty's face. 
 
(4) Form a "C" around the ventilation port. Hold your index finger over the lower part of 
the mask and your thumb over the upper part of the mask. Use the third, fourth and fifth fingers 
under the casualty's jaw to hold the mask in place. 
NOTE: The most difficult part of performing rescue breathing using the BVM system is 
maintaining an adequate seal. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends two rescuer 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-154 
 
3 May 2013 
BVM ventilation; in this method, one rescuer maintains a two-hand seal while the other rescuer 
squeezes the bag. 
 
(5) Squeeze the bag every five to six seconds. Deliver each breath over one second, just 
enough to produce visible chest rise. 
 
(6) Release pressure from the bag and allow the casualty to exhale passively. 
 
 
(a) If the chest rises and air goes in, squeeze the bag again to give a second breath 
and then go to step 6. 
 
 
(b) If the chest fails to rise, go to step 4. 
CAUTION: When using the FROPVD on casualties with chest injuries, be careful not to force 
excessive air into the stomach instead of the lungs. This may cause gastric distention and 
vomiting. Do not use this device on infants or children. 
 
e. Flow-restricted oxygen-powered ventilation device (FROPVD). 
 
(1) Follow the same steps to position and seal the mask as with the BVM system. 
 
(2) Push the trigger/button on the device once. 
 
 
(a) If the chest rises, push the trigger/button again and proceed to step 6. 
 
 
(b) If the chest fails to rise, go to step 4. 
 4. Reposition the head to ensure an open airway and attempt the breath again if the chest 
does not rise or breath does not enter with first breath. 
 
a. If the chest rises, give another breath and go to step 6. 
 
b. If the chest does not rise, continue with step 5. 
 5. Clear an airway obstruction, if necessary. (See task 081-831-0019.) When the obstruction 
has been cleared, continue with step 6. 
 6. Check the carotid pulse for at least five seconds but no longer than 10 seconds. 
 
a. While maintaining the airway, place the index and middle fingers of your hand on the 
casualty's throat. 
 
b. Slide the fingers into the groove beside the casualty's Adam's apple and feel for a pulse 
for no longer than 10 seconds. 
 
c. If a pulse is present, go to step 7. 
 
d. If a pulse is not found, initiate CPR. (See task 081-831-0046.) 
 7. Continue rescue breathing. 
 
a. Ventilate the casualty at the appropriate rate. 
 
(1) Adult: 12-20 breaths per minute. 
 
(2) Children (one year of age to the onset of puberty): 15-30 breaths per minute (mouthto-mouth or mouth-to-nose). 
 
(3) Infants (less than one year of age): 25-50 breaths per minute (mouth-to-nose). 
 
b. Watch for rising and falling of the chest. 
 8. Complete all steps in order.

Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, a CPR mannequin must be used. Position the mannequin on 
its back. To test step 1, create a trauma or non-trauma scenario that will dictate which 
maneuver should be used. To test step 2, create a scenario in which the casualty’s condition 
dictates which method is to be used. You may determine how much of the task is tested by 
telling the Soldier whether the airway is clear or a pulse is found as the Soldier proceeds 
through the task. However, you should ensure that the Soldier is routed through the task far 
enough to continue rescue breathing after checking the carotid pulse.

Insert an Oropharyngeal Airway (J Tube) 
081-833-0016 
WARNING: Use an oropharyngeal airway (OPA) adjunct for an unconscious casualty only. Do 
not use an OPA adjunct on a conscious or semiconscious casualty because they may still have 
an active gag reflex. In such cases, a nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) adjunct would be more 
appropriate. An OPA should not be used in children who may have ingested a caustic or 
petroleum-based product, as it may induce vomiting. 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You have an unconscious casualty requiring an oropharyngeal airway adjunct, 
(OPA). You will need three different sized OPAs, gauze pads or disposable tongue depressors. 
You have performed a patient care hand wash and body substance isolation precautions are 
taken. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Insert an OPA without causing further injury to the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Select the appropriate size of OPA. 
 
a. Place the airway beside the outside of the casualty's jaw. 
 
b. Measure from the casualty's ear lobe to the corner of the mouth. 
NOTE: The measurement from the ear lobe to the corner of the casualty's mouth is equivalent 
to the depth of insertion in the airway. 
WARNING: If a neck or spinal injury is suspected, use the jaw thrust maneuver to open the 
airway. 
 2. Perform the head-tilt/chin-lift or jaw thrust maneuver to open the airway. (See task 081-8310018.) 
 3. Open the casualty's mouth. 
 
a. Place the crossed thumb and index finger of one hand on the casualty's upper and lower 
teeth at the corner of the mouth. 
 
b. Use a scissors motion to pry the casualty's teeth apart. 
NOTE: If the teeth are clenched, wedge the index finger behind the casualty's back molars to 
open the mouth. 
 4. Insert the OPA. 
 
a. Insert the airway with the tip facing the roof of the mouth. 
 
b. Slide the OPA along the roof of the mouth. Follow the natural contour of the tongue past 
the soft palate. 
 
c. Rotate the airway 180 degrees as the tip reaches the back of the tongue. 
NOTE: The airway may be difficult to insert. If so, use a gauze pad to pull the tongue forward or 
a tongue blade to depress the tongue. 
WARNING: If the casualty starts to regain consciousness and gags or vomits, remove the 
airway immediately. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-157 
 
d. Gently advance the airway and adjust it so the flange rests against the casualty's lips or 
teeth. 
NOTE: The tip of the airway should rest just above the epiglottis. If the flange of the airway did 
not seat correctly on the lips, repeat the procedure using a different size of airway. 
 5. Evacuate the casualty. 
NOTE: The airway may need to be taped or tied in place to avoid dislodgement during 
evacuation. If so, the casualty must be constantly monitored for the return of consciousness. 
 6. Did not cause further injury to the casualty. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) mannequin 
capable of accepting an OPA.

Ventilate a Patient with a Bag-Valve-Mask System 
081-833-0017 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You have an unconscious patient requiring ventilation. You will need a bag-valvemask (BVM) system, oropharyngeal airway (OPA), supplemental oxygen (if available), a DD 
Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC) and pen. You have performed a patient care hand 
wash. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Ventilate the patient with a BVM system until spontaneous breathing returns, until a 
normal rate and depth of respiration is achieved, or until directed to stop by a medical officer. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Take appropriate body substance isolation. 
 2. Position yourself at the top of the patient's head. 
 3. Open the patient's airway using the head-tilt, chin-lift or jaw thrust maneuver. (See task 
081-833-0018.) 
NOTE: An operational BVM should have a self-refilling bag, a non-rebreathing outlet valve, 
oxygen reservoir, a one-way inlet valve, and a transparent face mask. 
 4. Insert an appropriate airway adjunct. (See task number 081-833-0016.) 
NOTE: Do not attempt to use an oropharyngeal airway (OPA) on a conscious or semiconscious 
patient. If the patient is unresponsive an OPA or a nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) should be 
inserted to help maintain a patent airway. 
 5. Assemble the BVM system, selecting the correct size of mask for the patient. 
NOTE: Ensure the bag is operational. An operational BVM should have a self-refilling bag, a 
non-rebreathing outlet valve, oxygen reservoir and a transparent face mask. 
 6. Perform an E-C technique to hold mask in place over patient's mouth. 
 
a. Your thumb should be placed over the part of the mask covering the bridge of the nose 
and your index finger is placed over the part covering the cleft above the chin. 
 
b. Seal the mask firmly on the face by pushing down with the thumb and index finger while 
pulling up on the mandible with the other finger to maintain the head-tilt, chin-lift maneuver. 
 
c. The E-C hand position technique will be performed using one hand. 
 7. Ventilate the patient using the one-rescuer method, if appropriate. 
 
a. Maintain a leak proof mask seal with one hand. Use firm pressure to hold the mask in 
position and to maintain a seal on the patient's face. 
 
b. Squeeze the bag with one hand while observing the chest rise to make certain the lungs 
are being inflated effectively. 
NOTE: The bag may alternatively be compressed against your body or forearm to deliver a 
greater tidal volume to the patient or help with hand fatigue. 
 
c. Ventilate patient for approximately one minute and then connect to oxygen (if available) 
to increase the percentage of oxygen from 55% to approximately 90-100%. 
 
d. Continue squeezing the bag once every five to six seconds (10-12 breaths/minute), for 
an adult patient. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-159 
 8. Ventilate the patient using the two-rescuer method, if appropriate. 
 
a. Hold the mask in place with two hands. 
 
(1) Place your little, ring, and middle fingers along the mandible. 
 
(2) Place your thumb on the upper portion of the mask above the valve connection. 
 
(3) Place your index finger on the lower portion of the mask under the valve connection. 
 
(4) With your other hand, duplicate the above steps (mirror image) to achieve a leak 
proof seal. 
 
b. Have your assistant continue squeezing the bag with two hands until the chest rises; 
squeeze once every five to six seconds (10-12 breaths/minute), for an adult. 
NOTE: Oxygen should be connected to the reservoir (if available) at 15 lpm. This will increase 
the oxygen from 55% to approximately 90-100%. 
Ventilations should not be interrupted for more than 30 seconds at any time. 
 9. Observe for rise and fall of the patient's chest. 
 
a. If the chest does not rise, reposition the airway. 
 
b. If the chest rises and falls, continue with step 10. 
 10. Continue ventilations. 
 
a. Observe for spontaneous respirations. 
 
b. Periodically check the pulse. 
 
c. Observe for vomiting or secretions in or around the mouth or mask. 
 11. Document all medical care and procedures on the FMC. 
 12. Evacuate the patient. 
 13. Do not cause further injury to the patient. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) mannequin 
capable of accepting an OPA. Have another Soldier act as an assistant. If oxygen will be used, 
prepare the oxygen source. Tell the Soldier if oxygen is to be used and whether the patient is 
conscious or unconscious. Have the Soldier insert an OPA and ventilate the patient with a BVM 
using the one rescuer method and two rescuer methods. After 2 minutes of ventilation, tell the 
Soldier that the patient has resumed normal breathing. Tell the assisting Soldier only to perform 
those actions the Soldier being evaluated directs them to perform.

Perform Oral Suctioning 
081-833-0099 
Conditions: You have a patient that requires suctioning. You will need a portable suction 
apparatus, (a suction kit if available), suction tubing, a rigid or flexible suction catheter, saline 
solution, a basin, a collection bottle, a pen, and a SF 600 Chronological Record of Medical 
Care. You have performed a patient care hand wash. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform oral suctioning to clear the airway without causing injury to the patient. 
NOTE : Wear eye protection when performing suctioning procedures. 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
1. Position the conscious patient in a semi-Fowler's (semi-sitting) position or, in the case of 
severe trauma, roll the patient onto his side to allow gravity to assist in clearing the airway. 
NOTE: In some cases, such as spinal injuries, the patient must remain in whatever position they 
are initially found in or must be managed while they are immobilized on a long spine board. 
 
2. Turn on the suction unit to see if it is operational. 
NOTE : Inspect the suction unit regularly to ensure it is in working condition. Switch on the 
suction, clamp the tubing, and make certain the unit generates a vacuum of more than 300 mm 
Hg. Check that a battery-charged unit has charged batteries. 
 
3. Select the appropriate catheter and attach it to the suction tubing. 
a. Tonsil-tip (Yankauer) catheters are best for suctioning in the field, as they have wide 
diameter tips and are somewhat rigid. 
NOTE: Suction catheters must be disposable and capable of being connected to the suction 
unit's tubing. 
b. If the nasal passages need to be suctioned, select a soft, flexible (French or Whistle Tip) 
catheter and use low to medium suction (80-120 mmHg). 
NOTE: Flexible (French, or whistle-tip) catheters are used in situations where rigid catheters 
cannot be used, such as a patient with clenched teeth or for use in nasopharyngeal suctioning. 
 
4. Prepare equipment. 
 
 a. Open the basin package. 
 
 b. Pour the saline solution into the basin. c. Open the suction catheter package. 
 
5. Explain to the patient the reason for suctioning. 
 
6. Pre-oxygenate the patient with 100% oxygen. 
 
 a. If the patient is receiving oxygen therapy, increase the oxygen to 100% for 1 minute. 
b. Monitor the patient's pulse oximeter reading during the entire procedure. (See task 081833-0164.) 
c. If the patient is not receiving oxygen therapy, have him take a minimum of five deep 
breaths or administer the breaths with a bag-valve-mask (BVM) system. 
NOTE: After each suctioning attempt or suctioning period, re-oxygenate the patient.

7. Put on gloves. 
 
8. Remove the catheter from the package using your dominant hand. 
 
9. Test the patency of the catheter. 
 
 a. Turn the suction unit on with your non-dominant hand. 
 
 b. Pick up attached suction tubing using your non-dominant hand. 
NOTE: The suction tubing is considered contaminated. After this is touched, then that hand is 
considered contaminated. 
c. Attach catheter being held by dominant hand to suction tubing being held by your nondominant hand. 
 
 d. Insert the catheter tip into the saline solution using your dominant hand. 
NOTE: Moistening the catheter lubricates the catheter and helps to minimize trauma to the 
mucous membranes and increases the patient's comfort. 
e. Occlude the suction control port with your non-dominant thumb and observe the saline 
entering the drainage bottle. Note: If no saline enters the bottle, check the suction unit 
and/or replace the catheter and retest for patency. 
 
10. Suction the patient. 
 
 a. Rigid catheter. 
(1) Instruct a conscious patient to cough to help bring secretions up to the back of his 
throat. 
(2) If the patient is unconscious, use the cross finger method of opening the airway. (See 
task 081-831-0019.) 
(3) Place the convex (outward curving) side of the rigid tip against the roof of the mouth 
and insert to the base of the tongue. 
NOTE: A rigid tip does not need to be measured. Only insert the tip as far as you can see it. Be 
aware that advancing the catheter too far may stimulate the patient's gag reflex and cause him 
to vomit. 
WARNING: Never suction for more than 15 seconds at one time for adults, 10 seconds for 
children and 5 seconds for infants. Longer periods of continuous suctioning may cause oxygen 
deprivation. 
(4) Apply suction by placing the thumb of your non-dominant hand over the suction 
control port. 
(5) Clear the secretions from the catheter between each suctioning interval by inserting 
the tip into the saline solution and suction the solution through the catheter until the 
catheter is clear of secretions. 
(6) Repeat steps 10a(1) through 10a(5) until all secretions have been removed or until 
the patient's breathing becomes easier. Noisy, rattling or gurgling sounds should no 
longer be heard. 
 
 b. Flexible catheter. 
(1) Measure the catheter from the patient's earlobe to the corner of the mouth or the 
center of the mouth to the angle of the jaw. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-163 
WARNING: Insert the catheter no farther down than the base of the tongue. 
(2) Insert the catheter into the patient's mouth to the correct depth, without the suction 
applied. 
NOTE: If an oropharyngeal airway (OPA) is in place, insert the catheter alongside the airway 
and then back into the pharynx. 
(3) Place the thumb of your non-dominant hand over the suction control port on the 
catheter, applying intermittent suction by moving your thumb up and down over the 
suction control port. 
 
 
(4) Apply suction in a circular motion as you withdraw the catheter. 
WARNING:Advancing the catheter too far into the back of the patient's throat may stimulate the 
gag reflex. This could cause vomiting and the aspiration of stomach contents. 
(5) Suction for no longer than 15 seconds removing secretions from the back of the 
throat, along outer gums, cheeks, and base of tongue. 
(6) Clear the secretions from the catheter between suctioning by inserting the tip into the 
saline solution and suction the solution through the catheter until the catheter is clear of 
secretions. 
(7) Repeat steps 10b(2) through 10b(6) until all secretions have been removed or until 
the patient's breathing becomes easier. Noisy, rattling or gurgling sounds should no 
longer be heard. 
11. Re-oxygenate the patient and/or ventilate for at least five assisted ventilations. 
12. Observe the patient for hypoxemia. 
 
a. Color change. 
WARNING: Discontinue suctioning immediately if severe changes in color or pulse rate occur. 
 
b. Increased or decreased pulse rate. 
13. Place the patient in the recovery (lateral recumbent, coma) position. 
14. Record the procedure on the SF 600. 
15. Do not cause further injury to the patient. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use another Soldier to be the simulated patient. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier the simulated patient has a respiratory emergency and they will 
need to initiate treatment.

Administer Oxygen 
081-833-0158 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring oxygen administration. You will need an oxygen tank 
with a PIN index system, a pressure regulator with a pressure gauge an adjustable-liter-flow 
outlet, a key or wrench, sterile water, humidifier, non-rebreather mask (NRB) with extension 
tubing, a nasal cannula, pen and SF 600 (Medical Record Chronological Record of Medical 
Care). You have taken body substance isolation precautions and you are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Administer oxygen therapy using an NRB mask or nasal cannula to assist the 
patient's breathing without causing further harm to the patient. Calculate the duration of flow of 
the oxygen. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Explain procedure to patient. 
 2. Assemble the equipment. 
NOTE: Ensure the cylinder (bottle or tank) is labeled for medical oxygen. All medical grade 
oxygen cylinders are color coded green, silver or chrome to make easy identification of the 
cylinder. They come in a variety of sizes, each size designated by a specific color. 
 
a. Remove protective seal. 
 
b. Crack the main cylinder for one second to remove dust, debris, and check for leaks. 
NOTE: Make sure cylinder is stabilized during entire process of assembly and once in use by 
patient. 
 
c. Place yoke of the regulator over the cylinder valve and align the pins. 
 
d. Hand-tighten the T-screw on the regulator. 
 
e. Open the main cylinder valve to check the pressure. 
NOTE: The safe residual level of the oxygen at which the cylinder should be replaced has been 
established to be 200 pounds per square inch (psi). 
WARNING: Disposable humidifiers are available for one-time use. 
CAUTION: Humidified oxygen is usually more comfortable to the patient and is particularly 
helpful for children and for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. They 
provide moisture to the dry oxygen. 
 
f. Attach the oxygen delivery device to the regulator. 
NOTE: Compressed oxygen that is stored in cylinders is extremely dry and can cause dryness 
and irritation to the mucous membranes, especially in the nasal passages. 
 3. Position patient in position of comfort. 
 4. Determine oxygen delivery device. 
 
a. A bag-valve-mask (BVM) system is the delivery device of choice for patient's with signs 
of severe inadequate breathing. (See task 081-833-0017.) 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-166 
 
3 May 2013 
 
b. A non-rebreather mask (NRB) is usually the delivery device of choice in the prehospital 
setting for patients with signs of inadequate breathing, who are cyanotic, have chest pain, 
severe trauma, signs of shock or an altered mental status. 
 
c. A nasal cannula is appropriate for those who are unable to tolerate a NRB. 
 5. Adminster oxygen with appropriate device. 
 
a. Apply the NRB. 
 
(1) Select the correct sized mask. 
NOTE: The apex of the mask should fit over the bridge of the patient's nose and extend to rest 
on the chin, covering the mouth and nose completely. NRB masks come in different sizes for 
adults, children and infants. 
 
(2) Connect tubing to regulator. 
 
(3) Set the regulator to 15 lpm (liters per minute). The oxygen concentration delivered is 
usually around 90 percent. 
 
(4) Fill the resevoir bag completely. 
NOTE: You may need to press down on the rubber valve gasket found covering the one-way 
valve between the mask and the reservoir. This will cause the bag to fill much faster. 
 
(5) Fit mask to patient's face. 
 
 
(a) Bring elastic strap around the back of the head and secure it. 
 
 
(b) Form the soft metal piece at the top of the mask to conform to the patient's nose. 
 
 
(c) Instruct the patient to breathe normally. 
 
 
(d) Continually monitor the reservoir bag to ensure that it remains filled during 
inhalation. 
 
b. Apply the nasal cannula. 
 
(1) Connect tubing to regulator. 
 
(2) Insert the two prongs of the cannula into the patient's nostrils with the tab pointing 
down. 
NOTE: Make sure nasal prongs are pointing downward. 
 
WARNING: Do not make tubing too tight. If an elastic strap is used, adjust it so it is secure and 
comfortable. 
 
(3) Position tubing over and behind each ear. Gently secure it by sliding the adjuster 
underneath the chin. 
 
(4) Set the regulator to 1-6 lpm. The delivered oxygen concentration ranges from 22% to 
44%. 
 
(5) Instruct patient to breathe normally. 
 
(6) Check the cannula position periodically to ensure that it has not dislodged. 
 6. Continue to monitor patient. 
NOTE: Continue to monitor patient for worsening vital signs, confusion, restlessness and altered 
mental status. 
 7. Check the equipment. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-167 
NOTE: Ensure tubing connections and device are secure, especially with movement of the 
patient. Monitor oxygen flow. Change the delivery device and tubing every 24 hours, or more 
often IAW local protocols. If humidifier is attached, water should be changed every shift or more 
often IAW with local protocols. 
 8. Calculate the duration of flow of the oxygen cylinder. 
 
a. Determine the remaining pressure in the tank by reading the regulator guage. 
 
b. Determine the safe residual level of the oxygen cylinder. 
NOTE: The safe residual level of the oxygen at which the cylinder should be replaced has been 
established to be 200 psi. 
 
c. Determine the available cylinder pressure by subtracting the safe residual level from the 
remaining pressure. Example: 2,000 psi remaining pressure minus 200 psi safe residual level = 
1,800 psi available pressure. 
 
d. Determine the conversion factor for the oxygen cylinder in use. 
NOTE: Each type of oxygen cylinder, depending on its size, employs a specific conversion 
factor. D size oxygen cylinder-0. 16; E size oxygen cylinder-0. 28; G size oxygen cylinder-2. 41; H 
size oxygen cylinder-3. 14; K size oxygen cylinder-3. 14; M size oxygen cylinder-1. 56. 
 
e. Determine available liters by multiplying the conversion factor by the amount of available 
pressure. Example: A D size cylinder is being used. 0. 16 conversion factor x 1,800 psi available 
pressure = 288 liters of oxygen available for use. 
 
f. Determine the flow rate as prescribed by medical direction. 
 
g. Determine the duration of the oxygen by dividing the available liters by the flow rate. 
Example: 288 available liters divided by the prescribed flow rate of 15 lpm = 19. 2 minutes 
duration of oxygen flow. 
 9. Follow safety precautions. 
 
a. Never allow combustible materials such as oil or grease to touch the cylinder, regulator, 
fittings, valves or hoses. 
 
b. Ensure "OXYGEN" and "NO SMOKING" signs are posted wherever oxygen is used or 
stored. 
WARNING: The principle danger in using oxygen is fire. The presence of oxygen in increased 
concentrations makes all materials more combustible. Materials that burn slowly in ordinary air, 
burn violently and even explosively in the presence of oxygen. 
 
c. Inform the patient and visitors about the restrictions. 
 
d. Use only non-sparking wrenches on oxygen cylinders. 
 
e. Position oxygen cylinders away from doors and high traffic areas. 
 
f. Secure and store oxygen cylinders in an upright postion. 
WARNING: When you are working with an oxygen cylinder, never place any part of your body 
over the cylinder valve. A full cylinder is at 2,000 psi and if the tank is punctured or if a valve 
breaks off, any oxygen cylinder can accelerate with enough force to penetrate concrete walls. 
 13. Do not cause further injury to the patient. 
WARNING: A loosely fitting regulator can be blown off the cylinder with sufficient force to 
decapitate a person, penetrate the body or demolish any object in its path. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-168 
 
3 May 2013 
 
g. Keep all valves closed when the oxygen cylinder is not in use, even if the tank is empty. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the patient; tell the patient not to 
assist the Soldier in any way. Place the unassembled oxygen cylinder and regulator along with 
a non-sparking wrench, NRB mask, extension tubing and nasal cannula next to the patient. 
Once the NRB has been placed on the patient, inform the Soldier that the patient is not able to 
tolerate the NRB mask. The Soldier should then substitute the nasal cannula for the NRB.

Perform a Surgical Cricothyroidotomy 
081-833-3005 
CAUTION: Casualties with a total upper airway obstruction, inhalation burns, or massive 
maxillofacial trauma who cannot be ventilated by other means are candidates for a surgical 
cricothyroidotomy. 
Conditions: You have a casualty requiring a surgical cricothyroidotomy. You will need a cutting 
instrument (scalpel, knife blade), airway tube (endotracheal (ET) tube, tracheotomy tube, or any 
non-collapsible tube, suctioning apparatus, alcohol swabs, knife handle, gloves, and tape. You 
are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform a surgical cricothyroidotomy without causing unnecessary injury to the 
casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Gather cricothyroidotomy kit or minimum essential equipment. 
NOTE: Because of the need for speed, every medic should have an easily accessible 
cricothyroidotomy kit that contains all required items. 
 
a. Cutting instrument: No. 10 or 15 scalpel or knife blade. 
 
b. Airway tube: ET tube, tracheotomy tube, or any non-collapsible tube that will allow 
enough airflow to maintain oxygen saturation. 
NOTE: In a field setting, an ET tube is preferred because it is easy to secure. Use a size 6. 0 to 
7. 0 ET tube, and ensure the cuff will hold air. 
 2. Put on gloves. 
WARNING: Do not hyperextend the casualty's neck if a cervical injury is suspected. 
 3. Hyperextend the casualty's neck. 
 
a. Place the casualty in the supine position. 
 
b. Place a blanket or poncho rolled up under the casualty's neck or between the shoulder 
blades to hyperextend the neck. 
 4. Locate the cricothyroid membrane. 
 
a. Place a finger of the non-dominant hand on the thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple), and 
slide the finger down to the cricoid cartilage. 
 
b. Palpate for the soft cricothyroid membrane below the thyroid cartilage and just above the 
cricoid cartilage. 
 
c. Slide the index finger down into the depression between the thyroid and cricoid cartilage. 
 
d. Prepare the skin over the membrane with an alcohol swab. 
 5. Stabilize the larynx with the non-dominant hand. 
 6. With the cutting instrument in the dominant hand, make a 1 1/2 inch vertical incision 
through the skin over the cricothyroid membrane. 
NOTE: A vertical incision will allow visualization of the cricothyroid membrane, but keep the 
scalpel blade away from the lateral aspect of the neck. This is important because of the large 
blood vessels located in the lateral areas of the neck. 
CAUTION: Do not cut the cricothyroid membrane with this incision. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-172 
 
3 May 2013 
 7. Maintain the opening of the skin incision by pulling the skin taut with the fingers of the nondominant hand. 
 8. Stabilize the larynx with one hand and cut horizontally through the cricothyroid membrane. 
 9. Insert a commercially designed cricothyroidotomy hook or improvise with the tip of an 18gauge needle formed into a hook through the opening; hook the cricoid cartilage, and lift to 
stabilize the opening. 
 10. Insert the end of the ET tube or tracheotomy tube through the opening and towards the 
lungs. The tube should be in the trachea and directed toward the lungs. Inflate the cuff 10 cubic 
centimeters (cc) of air. 
 11. Assess the casualty for spontaneous respirations (10 seconds). 
 12. Attach a pulse oximeter to the casualty, if available. 
 13. Assist with ventilations when respirations are <8 or >30 or a pulse oximeter reading <90%. 
Direct an assistant to ventilate the casualty with a BVM, if necessary. 
 14. Auscultate lung fields and watch for rise and fall of the chest to confirm tube placement. 
 15. Secure the tube, using tape, cloth ties, or other measures, and apply a dressing to further 
protect the tube and incision. 
 16. Monitor the casualty's respirations on a regular basis. 
 
a. Reassess air exchange and placement every time the casualty is moved. 
 
b. Assist with respirations if the respiratory rate falls below 8 or rises above 30 per minute. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use a mannequin. If a Soldier is used UNDER NO 
circumstances is the skin to actually be incised. Have the evaluated Soldier explain the

pads, sterile 2 x 2 gauze sponges, betadine or alcohol, adhesive bandage strips, protective pad, 
labels, and gloves. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Obtain a blood specimen without causing injury to the patient or violating aseptic 
technique. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Verify the medical officer's order to obtain a blood specimen. 
 2. Select the proper blood specimen tube for the ordered test. 
 3. Label the blood specimen tube with the information necessary to identify the patient in 
accordance with (IAW) local standard operating procedure (SOP). 
WARNING: Gloves should be worn for self-protection against transmission of contaminants 
whenever handling body fluids. 
 4. Perform a patient care handwash. 
 5. Put on gloves. 
 6. Assemble the vacutainer adapter, the needle, and the blood specimen tube. 
 
a. Inspect the needle for nicks or barbs. Replace the needle if it is flawed or dull. 
 
b. Insert the rubber stoppered end of the specimen tube into the vacutainer holder and 
advance the tube until it is even with the guideline. 
 7. Identify the patient using two patient identifiers IAW local SOP. 
 8. Explain the procedure and purpose for collecting the blood specimen to the patient. 
 9. Position the patient. 
WARNING: Never attempt to draw blood from a standing patient. 
 
a. Assist the patient into a comfortable sitting or lying position. 
 
b. The patient should be positioned so the arm is well supported and stabilized by using a 
pillow, table, or other flat surface. 
 
c. Place a protective pad under the elbow and forearm. 
 10. Expose the area for venipuncture. 
WARNING: Do not use the vacutainer to draw blood from small or fragile veins because this 
can cause the vein wall to collapse. Use a needle and syringe instead. 
CAUTION: Avoid veins that are infected, irritated, injured or have an intravenous (IV) injection 
running distal to the proposed venipuncture site. 
 11. Select and palpate one of the prominent veins in the bend of the arm (antecubital space). 
 
a. The first choice is the median cubital vein. It is well supported and least apt to roll. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-175 
 
b. The second choice is the cephalic vein. 
 
c. The third choice is the basilic vein. Although it is often the most prominent, it tends to roll 
easily and makes venipuncture difficult. 
 12. Prepare the sponges for use. 
 
a. Open the betadine or alcohol and 2 X 2 gauze sponge packages. 
 
b. Place them within easy reach (still in the packages). 
 13. Apply the constricting band with enough pressure to stop venous return without stopping 
the arterial flow (a radial pulse will be present). 
 
a. Wrap the constricting band around the limb approximately 2 inches above the selected 
venipuncture site. 
 
b. Instruct the patient to form a fist, clench and unclench several times, and then hold the 
fist in a clenched position. 
 14. Palpate the selected vein lightly with the index finger, moving an inch or two in either 
direction so that the size and direction of the vein can be determined. The vein should feel like a 
spongy tube. 
WARNING: Do not leave the constricting band on for more than 2 minutes. 
CAUTION: After cleansing the skin, do not re-palpate the area. 
 15. Cleanse the area around the puncture site with a disinfectant soaked pad or an alcohol 
pad, using an outward circular motion. 
 16. Prepare to puncture the vein. 
 
a. Grasp the vacutainer unit and remove the protective needle cover. 
 
b. Position the needle directly in line with the vein. Using the free hand, grasp the patient's 
arm below the expected point of entry. 
 
c. Place the thumb of the free hand approximately 1 inch below the expected point of entry 
and pull the skin taut toward the hand. 
 17. Puncture the vein. 
 
a. Place the needle, bevel up, in line with the vein and pierce the skin at a 15 to 30 degree 
angle. 
 
b. Decrease the angle until the needle is almost parallel to the skin surface. Direct it toward 
the vein and pierce the vein wall. 
NOTE: A faint "give" may be felt when the vein is entered and blood will appear in the hub of the 
needle. 
 
CAUTION: If the needle is withdrawn above the skin surface, quickly release the constricting 
band and stop the procedure. Begin again with a new needle. 
 
(1) If the venipuncture is unsuccessful, pull the needle back slightly (not above the skin 
surface) and attempt to pierce the vein again. 
 
(2) If the venipuncture is still unsuccessful, release the constricting band, place a gauze 
sponge lightly over the site, quickly withdraw the needle, and immediately apply pressure to the 
site. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-176 
 
3 May 2013 
 
(3) Notify the supervisor before attempting to enter another vein. 
 
c. Instruct the patient to unclench the fist. 
 18. Collect the specimen. 
 
a. Single specimen sample. 
 
(1) With the dominant hand, hold the vacutainer unit and the needle steady. 
WARNING: If the unit and needle are not held steady while pushing in the tube, the needle may 
either slip out of the vein or puncture the opposing vein wall. 
 
(2) Place the index and middle fingers of the free hand behind the flange of the 
vacutainer and ease the tube as far forward as possible. Blood will enter the tube. 
 
(3) After the tube is approximately two-thirds full of blood or the flow of blood stops, 
prepare to withdraw the needle. 
 
b. Multiple specimen samples (multiple tubes). 
 
(1) Follow steps 18a(1) and 18a(2) for collecting a single specimen. 
 
(2) Remove the first tube and insert another tube into the vacutainer. 
 
(3) Repeat this procedure until the desired number of tubes are filled or blood stops 
flowing. 
 
(4) Release the constricting band using the non-dominant hand. 
 
(5) After the last tube is approximately two-thirds full of blood or the flow stops, prepare 
to withdraw the needle. 
NOTE: If the blood flow starts to slow down between samples, remove the constricting band. 
 19. Withdraw the needle. 
WARNING: Never withdraw the needle prior to removing the constricting band because this will 
cause blood to be forced out of the venipuncture site with resulting blood loss and/or hematoma 
formation. 
 
a. Release the constricting band by pulling on the long, looped end of the tubing or pulling 
the Velcro fasteners open. 
 
b. Remove the specimen tube from the vacutainer. 
 
c. Keeping the patient's arm fully extended, withdraw the needle smoothly and quickly. 
Immediately apply firm manual pressure over the venipuncture site with the sponge. 
 
d. Instruct the patient to elevate the arm slightly and keep the arm fully extended. Continue 
to apply firm manual pressure to the site for 2 to 3 minutes. 
 20. Apply an adhesive bandage strip to the venipuncture site after the bleeding has stopped. 
Adhesive bandage strips do not take the place of pressure and therefore, are not applied until 
the bleeding has stopped. 
 21. Provide for the patient's safety and comfort. 
 
a. Remove the protective pad. 
 
b. Assist the patient to assume a comfortable position. 
 22. Dispose of and/or store the equipment IAW local SOP. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-177 
 23. Remove the gloves. 
 24. Perform a patient care handwash. 
 25. Complete the laboratory request IAW local SOP. 
 
a. Patient identification. 
 
b. Requesting medical officer's name. 
 
c. Ward number or clinic. 
 
d. Date and time of specimen collection. 
 
e. Test(s) requested. 
 
f. Specimen source-blood. 
 
g. Remarks. Write in the admission diagnosis or the type of surgery in this section.

b. Check the identification band against the patient's chart, as appropriate. 
 
c. Explain the reason for IV therapy. 
 
d. Explain the procedure and caution the patient against manipulating the equipment. 
 
e. Ask about any known allergies to such things as antiseptic sponges, (alcohol, iodine, 
povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine) or medication. 
 2. Select and inspect the equipment for defects, expiration date, and contamination. 
 
a. IV fluid of choice (check medical officer's order). Discard containers that have cracks, 
scratches, leaks, sedimentation, condensation, or fluid which is not crystal clear and colorless. 
 
b. IV injection set. 
 
(1) Spike, drip chamber, tubing, and needle adapter. Discard them if there are cracks or 
holes or if any discoloration is present. 
 
(2) Flow regulator. Inspect the flow regulator and ensure that it tightens. 
 
(3) Catheter-over-needle. Discard them if they are flawed with barbs or nicks. 
NOTE: Place stand to the side of the patient and close to the IV site. 
 3. Prepare the equipment. 
 
a. Move the flow regulator 6 to 8 inches below the drip chamber and tighten/close it. 
CAUTION: Do not touch the spike or the outlet of the IV container. 
 
b. Remove the protective covers from the spike and from the outlet of the IV container. 
 
c. Push the spike firmly into the container's outlet tube. 
 
d. Hang the container at least 2 feet above the level of the patient's heart, if possible. 
NOTE: An IV bag container may be placed under the patient's body if there is no way to hang it. 
You must completely fill the drip chamber if you place it under the patient's body to prevent air 
from entering the tubing. 
 
e. Squeeze the drip chamber until it is half full of the IV fluid. 
 
f. Prime the tubing. 
NOTE: Ensure that all air is expelled from the tubing. 
 
(1) Hold the tubing above the level of the bottom of the container.

(2) Loosen the protective cover from the needle adapter to allow the air to escape. 
 
(3) Release the clamp on the tubing. 
 
(4) Gradually lower the tubing until the solution reaches the end of the needle adapter. 
 
(5) Tighten the flow regulator to stop the flow of IV fluids. 
 
(6) Retighten the needle adapter's protective cover. 
 
(7) Loop the tubing over the IV stand or holder. 
 
g. Cut several pieces of tape and hang them in a readily accessible place. 
 4. Select the infusion site. 
 
a. Put on gloves for body substance isolation. 
 
b. Choose the most distal and accessible vein of an uninjured arm or hand. 
 
c. Avoid sites over joints. 
 
d. Avoid veins in infected, injured, or irritated areas. 
CAUTION: Do not use an arm that may require an operative procedure. 
 
e. Use the non-dominant hand or arm, whenever possible. 
 
f. Select a vein large enough to accommodate the size of needle/catheter to be used. 
 5. Prepare the infusion site. 
 
a. Apply the constricting band. 
NOTE: When applying the constricting band, use soft-walled tubing about 18 inches in length. 
 
(1) Place the tubing around the limb, about 2 inches above the site of venipuncture. Hold 
one end so that it is longer than the other, and form a loop with the longer end. 
 
(2) Pass the looped end under the shorter end of the constricting band. 
NOTE: When placing the constricting band, ensure that the tails of the tubing are turned away 
from the proposed site of venipuncture. 
 
(3) Apply the constricting band tight enough to stop venous flow but not so tightly that 
the radial pulse cannot be felt. 
CAUTION: Do not leave the constricting band in place for more than 2 minutes. 
 
(4) Tell the patient to open and close his fist several times to increase circulation. 
 
b. Select a prominent vein. 
 
c. Tell the patient to close his fist and keep it closed until instructed to open the fist. 
 
d. Clean the skin over the selected area with 70% alcohol or betadine, using a firm circular 
motion from the center outward. 
 
e. Allow the skin to dry and discard the gauze. 
 6. Prepare to puncture the vein. 
 
a. Pick up the assembled needle and remove the protective cover with the other hand.

(2) Place the forefinger on the needle hub to guide it during insertion through the skin 
and into the vein. 
 
b. Position yourself so as to have a direct line of vision along the axis of the vein to be 
entered. 
CAUTION: Keep the needle at the same angle to prevent through-and-through penetration of 
the vein walls. 
 7. Puncture the vein. 
NOTE: You may position the needle directly above the vein or slightly to one side of the vein. 
 
a. Draw the skin below the cleaned area downward to hold the skin taut over the site of 
venipuncture. 
 
b. Position the needle point, bevel up, parallel to the vein and about 1/2 inch below the site 
of venipuncture. 
 
c. Hold the needle at a 20 to 30 degree angle and insert it through the skin. 
 
d. Decrease the angle of the needle until it is almost parallel to the skin surface and direct it 
toward the vein. Always hold the catheter by the clear plastic flashback chamber and not by the 
colored hub. 
 
e. Advance the catheter approximately 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0. 5 to 1. 5 cm) into the vein. 
 8. Confirm the puncture. 
NOTE: A faint "give" will be felt as the needle enters the lumen of the vein. 
 
a. Check for blood in the flash chamber. If successful, proceed to step 9. 
 
b. If the venipuncture is unsuccessful, pull the needle back slightly (not above the skin 
surface) and attempt to pierce the vein again. 
 
c. If the venipuncture is still unsuccessful, release the constricting band and tell the patient 
to open and relax his clinched fist. 
 
(1) Place a sponge lightly over the site and quickly withdraw the needle. 
 
(2) Immediately apply pressure to the site. 
 
d. Notify your supervisor before attempting a venipuncture at another site. 
 9. Advance the catheter-over-needle. 
 
a. Grasp the hub and with a slight twisting motion fully advance the catheter. 
 
b. While continuing to hold the hub, press lightly on the skin over the catheter tip with the 
fingers of the other hand. 
 
c. Remove the needle from inside the catheter and place it in the sharps container. 
WARNING: Do not allow air to enter the blood stream. 
 10. Remove the protective cover from the needle adapter on the tubing. Quickly and tightly 
connect the adapter to the catheter or needle hub. 
 11. Tell the patient to unclench the fist, and then release the constricting band. 
 12. Loosen the flow regulator and adjust the flow rate to keep the vein open (KVO) or to keep 
open (TKO) .

3 May 2013 
NOTE: A rate of about 30 cc per hour, or 7 to 10 drops per minute using standard drip tubing, is 
adequate to keep the vein open. 
 13. Check the site for infiltration. If it is painful, swollen, red, cool to the touch, or if fluid is 
leaking from the site, stop the infusion immediately. 
 14. Secure the site IAW local SOP. 
 
a. Apply a sterile dressing over the puncture site, leaving the hub and tubing connection 
visible. 
 
b. Loop the IV tubing onto the extremity and secure the loop with tape. 
 
c. Splint the arm loosely on a padded splint, if necessary, to reduce movement. 
 15. Readjust the flow rate. 
 
a. Determine the total time over which the patient is to receive the dosage. 
NOTE: Example: The patient is to receive the dosage over a 3 hour period. 
 
b. Determine the total IV dosage the patient is to receive by checking the medical officer's 
orders. 
NOTE: Example: The patient is to receive 1000 cc of IV fluid. 
 
c. Check the IV tubing package to determine the number of drops of IV fluid per cc the set 
has been designed to deliver. 
NOTE: Example: The set is designed to give 10 drops of IV fluid per cc (10 gtts/cc). 
 
d. Multiply the total hours (step 15a) by 60 minutes to determine the total minutes over 
which the IV dosage is to be administered. 
NOTE: Example: 3 hours X 60 min = 180 min. 
 
e. Divide the total IV dosage (step 15b) by the total minutes over which the IV dosage is to 
be administered (step 15d) to determine the cc of fluid to be administered per minute. 
 
f. Multiply the cc/min (step 15e) by the number of drops of IV fluid per cc delivered by the 
tubing (step 15c) to determine the number of drops per minute to be administered.

Manage an Intravenous Infusion 
081-833-0034 
Conditions: You have a patient who requires intravenous (IV) infusion maintenance. You will 
need Tegaderm®/dressings, antiseptic swabs, sterile gauze, IV administration set, IV solution, 
tape, exam gloves, and DD Form 792 (Nursing Service-Twenty-Four Hour Patient Intake and 
Output Worksheet (I/O)). You have performed a patient care hand wash and you are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Properly manage a patient with an IV infusion, without causing further injury to the 
patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Assess for signs and symptoms of IV therapy complications. 
 
a. Infiltration is an accumulation of fluids in the tissue surrounding an IV needle site. It is 
caused by penetration of the vein wall by the needle/catheter or later dislodgement of the 
catheter. 
 
(1) Solution flows sluggishly or not at all. 
 
(2) Discoloration or cool feeling around the infusion site. 
 
(3) Swollen extremity. 
 
(4) Fluid leaking from the infusion site. 
 
(5) Patient complains of pain, tenderness, irritation, or burning at the infusion site. 
 
b. Phlebitis is an inflammation of the wall of the vein. It is caused by injury to the vein during 
puncture or from irritation to the vein caused by long term therapy, incompatible additives, or 
use of a vein that is too small to handle the amount or type of solution. 
 
(1) Swelling, redness, and/or tenderness around the venipuncture site. 
 
(2) Sluggish flow rate. 
 
c. Infection is a yellowish, foul-smelling discharge (pus) from the venipuncture site. 
 
d. Air embolism is the obstruction of a blood vessel by air carried via the bloodstream 
(usually occurring in the lungs or heart). It is caused by conditions such as air bubbles in the IV 
tubing, a solution container that has run dry, or disconnected IV tubing. 
 
(1) Abrupt drop in blood pressure. 
 
(2) Chest pain. 
 
(3) Weak, rapid pulse. 
 
(4) Cyanosis. 
 
(5) Loss of consciousness. 
 
e. Circulatory overload is an increased blood volume that is caused by excessive IV fluid 
infused too rapidly into the vein (over hydration). 
 
(1) Elevated blood pressure. 
 
(2) Distended neck veins. 
 
(3) Rapid breathing, shortness of breath, tachycardia. 
 
(4) Fluid intake is much greater than urine output.

 2. Perform the nursing interventions for IV therapy complications. 
 
a. Infiltration. 
 
(1) Stop the infusion. 
 
(2) Notify your supervisor. 
 
(3) Record observations and action taken. 
 
b. Phlebitis. 
 
(1) Stop the infusion. 
 
(2) Report observations to your supervisor. 
 
(3) Record observations and actions taken. 
 
c. Infection. 
 
(1) Report observations to your supervisor. 
 
(2) Discontinue IV. 
 
(3) Record observations and actions taken. 
NOTE: Local policies may dictate a wound culture be taken to identify the specific pathogenic 
microorganism responsible for the infection. Do not dispose of used IV equipment unless you 
are sure it is not needed. 
 
d. Air embolism. 
 
(1) Report observations to the medical officer or supervisor. 
 
(2) Immediately place patient on left side with feet elevated to allow the pulmonary artery 
to absorb small air bubbles. 
 
(3) Administer oxygen. (See task 081-833-0158.) 
 
(4) Record observations and actions taken. 
 
e. Circulatory overload. 
 
(1) Slow the infusion rate to keep vein open (KVO). 
 
(2) Place the patient in the semi-Fowler's position. 
 
(3) Notify the medical officer or supervisor. 
 
(4) Record observations and actions taken. 
 
f. Preventive measures-frequently check flow rate to maintain desired rate.

Subject Area 6: Primary Care 
Provide Treatment for Sinus Infections 
081-833-0242 
Conditions: You have a patient complaining of a sinus infection. All other immediate life threats 
have been treated and managed. You have performed a patient care handwash and taken body 
substance isolation, (BSI), precautions. You will need an otoscope, disposable speculum 
attachments, penlight, or other light source, pen and SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological 
Record of Medical Care). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Provide treatment for common sinus infections without causing harm to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Gather equipment and supplies. 
 2. Identify patient and inquire about allergies. 
 3. Provide privacy and safety for the patient. 
 
a. Place patient in position of comfort, as long as procedure permits. 
 
b. Explain procedure to patient. 
 4. Perform an head, ears, eyes, nose and throat () examination. (See task 081-833-0254.) 
 5. Identify the sinus disorder. 
 
a. Seasonal allergies or allergic rhinitis (hay fever)–rhinitis is an inflammation of the nasal 
membranes. 
NOTE: The sensitized immune system produces antibodies to these allergens, which cause 
chemicals called histamines to be released into the blood stream. 
 
(1) Common causes–patients often have family history of multiple allergic disorders 
including hay fever, asthma and eczema. 
 
(2) Signs and sypmtoms include sneezing, swelling and itching, (puritis), of the affected 
tissue, increased mucous production (rhinorrhea), nasal congestion, hives and rashes. 
NOTE: Signs and symptoms are predominately in the nose and eyes. 
 
b. Sinus Infection (sinus pain/fullness)–general term. 
 
(1) Common causes–sinus infection may be caused by anything interfering with airflow 
into the sinuses and the drainage of mucous out of the sinuses. 
 
(2) Signs and syptoms can include those generally associated with colds and allergies. 
 
c. Acute sinusitis-inflammation/infection of the paranasal sinuses. 
 
(1) Common causes-infection by the pathogenic microorganism. These can be bacterial, 
viral or an allergen. 
 
(2) Signs and sypmtoms include headache, facial tenderness or pain, fever, cloudy, 
discolored nasal drainage, nasal stuffiness, sore throat and a cough. 
 6. Provide treatment for a sinus disorder. 
 
a. Increase fluids. 
 
b. Decongestant. 
 
c. Avoid antihistamines. Antihistamines dry and thicken the nasal mucosal areas.

Perform a HEENT Exam 
081-833-0254 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring a head, ears, eyes, nose and throat (HEENT) 
examination. All other apparent life threats have been treated and managed. You have 
performed a patient care handwash, taken body substance isolation (BSI) precautions. You will 
need an otoscope, disposable speculum attachments, tongue blades, pen light, pen, Snellen 
chart, and SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care). You are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform an HEENT examination without causing further injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Gather equipment and supplies. 
 2. Identify patient and inquire about allerigies. 
 3. Provide privacy and safety for the patient. 
 
a. Place patient in a position of comfort as long as the procedure permits. 
 
b. Explain procedure to the patient. 
 4. Perform a history and physical exam of the eyes. 
 
a. Patient history. 
NOTE: An accurate history is needed in establishing a possible cause for the eye problem. 
 
(1) Mechanism of injury (if there is a history of injury)? 
 
 
(a) Blunt trauma versus penetrating injury. 
 
 
(b) Was there a projectile or missile injury? (Glass from a motor vehicle accident.) 
 
 
(c) Thermal, chemical or laser burn? 
 
(2) Does the patient wear glasses or contact lenses? 
 
(3) History of eye disease or previous eye trauma/surgery? 
 
(4) Is there eye pain or loss of vision? If there is vision loss, is it in one eye or both? 
NOTE: Ocular injuries are classified as penetrating or non-penetrating. Eye injuries are common 
in spite of the protection by the bony orbit. 
 
b. Physical exam. 
WARNING: In cases of ocular burns, the eyes must be flushed first. Once the mechanism of the 
burn has been eliminated, then a visual acuity screening is accomplished. 
 
(1) Inpect and palpate in adequate lighting. 
NOTE: Avoid putting pressure on the globe while performing the exam. 
(3) Visual acuity is the most important step in evaluating ocular problems. 
Have the patient: 
 
 
(a) Read any available printed material. 
 
 
(b) Count fingers. 
NOTE: If the patient is unable to count fingers, assess their ability to detect hand motion 1 to 2 
inches in front of the eye. 
 
 
(c) Distinguish between light and dark.

3 May 2013 
CAUTION: When equipment, light and /or space do not permit a gross vision examination is 
recommended as opposed to no vision exam. 
 
 
(d) Read the Snellen chart (eye chart). (See task 081-833-0193.) 
NOTE: If the patient has corrective lenses, test without glasses first, and then test with glasses 
on. 
 
(3) Note any drainage or bleeding from the eye. 
 
(4) Inspect eyelids for: 
 
 
(a) Ability to open wide and close completely.

look down as you pull the upper lid upward. 
 
 
(a) Note color of conjunctiva, (pink to dark color is normal). 
 
 
(b) Inspect for erythema or exudate. 
 
 
(c) Note color of sclera (white is normal). 
NOTE: Patient's who have darker pigmented skin may have scattered areas of brown pigments, 
a normal finding, but this observation should be noted. 
 
(6) Inspect cornea (should be clear and avascular). 
 
(7) Inspect pupil-note any irregularity in the shape of the pupils. 
NOTE: Unequal size of pupils (anisocoria) may be congenital (approximately 20% of normal 
people have minor or noticeable differences in pupil size, but pupillary reaction is normal.) 
 
 
(a) Pupils should be equal, round, regular and reactive to light (PERRL). 
 
 
(b) Assess extra ocular movement. 
 
(8) Test pupillary reaction to light both directly and consensually. 
 
 
(a) Dim the lights in the room so that the pupils dilate. 
NOTE: Do not shine into both eyes simultaneously. 
 
 
(b) Shine a penlight directly into one eye and observe the pupil constrict. 
 
 
(c) Note consensual reaction response of the opposite pupil constricting 
simultaneously with the tested pupil. 
 5. Perform a history and physical exam of the ears. 
 
a. Patient history. 
 
(1) Ask patient about symptoms associated with ear problems, pain, swelling, redness, 
drainage. 
 
(2) Ask patient about history of recent illness, upper respiratory infection (URI), sore 
throat, or recent swimming.

NOTE: Diagnosis is confirmed with a throat culture however the MO may treat for this condition 
based on symptoms alone. 
 
(2) Antibiotics will be prescribed by the MO; penicillin has been traditionally 
recommended and is still very effective. 
CAUTION: Even though the sore throat usually gets better on its own, individuals who have 
strep throat must take antibiotics to prevent more serious complications of this infection, 
including rheumatic fever. 
 
c. Peri-tonsillar abscess (PTA). 
WARNING: This is a surgical emergency. 
 
(1) Referral to MO immediately. 
 
(2) Peri-tonsillar abscesses require urgent surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. 
 
d. Infectious mononucleosis. 
 
(1) Referral to MO. 
CAUTION: Patients are advised to avoid contact sports (football, etc.) for at least 30 days after 
diagnosis due to the increased risk of splenic rupture (rupture of the spleen). 
 
(2) The MO will may order a blood test (Monospot) along with a throat culture to rule out 
“strep” and confirm mononucleosis.

(7) Irritability. 
 
(8) Visual disturbances. 
 
(9) Other. 
 2. Perform a physical examination on the casualty. 
NOTE: There are five domains of neurological function: Orientation, Immediate Memory, 
Neurological Screening, Concentration and Delayed Recall. 
 
a. Orientation. 
 
(1) Ask the casualty to tell you the present month, date, and day of the week and time. 
 
(2) Award one point for each correct response with a maximum of five points. 
 
(3) Record the results. 
 
b. Immediate memory. 
 
(1) Ask the casualty to remember five words and repeat them in any order. 
 
(2) Repeat this two more times for a total of three times. 
 
(3) Award one point for each correct response for a maximum of 15 points. 
 
c. Neurological screening. 
 
(1) Check eyes for pupillary response and tracking. 
 
(2) Check speech for fluency and word finding. 
 
(3) Evaluate motor responses, gait and coordination. 
 
(4) Do not award points for these, but record any abnormalties. 
 
d. Concentration. 
 
(1) Provide the casualty with four strings of numbers and ask him to repeat them back to 
you in reverse order. 
 
(2) Ask the casualty to recite the months of the year in reverse order. 
 
(3) Award one point for each string of numbers correctly repeated and one point for the 
correct reversed sequence of months for a maximum of four points. 
 
(4) If the casualty fails to repeat the first two strings of numbers, stop and move to 
delayed recall. 
 
e. Delayed recall. 
 
(1) Ask the casualty to recall the five words from the previous memory test. 
 
(2) Award one point for each correct response for a maximum of five points. 
 3. Compute the total score on the MACE screening tool and determine whether a concussion 
has occurred or not. 
 4. Refer the casualty for further evaluation if the score is below 25. 
NOTE: Scores below 25 may represent clinically relevant neurocognitive impairment and 
require further evaluation for the possibility of a more serious brain injury.

impaction is caused by the improper use of Q-Tips®. 
 
(2) Signs and Symptoms can include hearing loss and dizziness. It rarely causes pain. 
 
b. Otitis Externa–O.E. (swimmers’ ear) inflammation and/or infection of the external 
auditory canal (EAC). 
 
(1) Common causes–excessive moisture in the ear canal(swimming, use of ear plugs or 
hearing aids) or trauma are the most common causes of O.E. Bacterial or viral causes are also 
common. It is rarely a fungal infection. 
 
(2) Signs and Symptoms include ear pain, ear canal swelling, drainage, and increased 
pain on movement of the auricle. A low grade fever may be present. 
 
c. Otitis media O.M. – middle ear infection. 
NOTE: Otitis media is a condition that is typically unilateral (occurs in one ear). 
 
(1) Common causes – viral and bacterial. 
 
(2) Signs and symptoms include fever, ear pain, decreased hearing in the affected ear, 
and the tympanic membrane (TM) will be bulging and red. 
NOTE: The cone of light that is commonly seen with an otoscopic examination will generally be 
absent.

Subject Area 7: Musculoskeletal 
Apply a Rigid Splint 
081-833-0263 
Conditions: You have a casualty with a suspected fracture to an arm or leg. All other more 
serious injuries have been assessed and treated. You will need a rigid or formable splint, four 
muslin bandages (cravats), three inch tape and a six inch elastic bandage. You are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Splint the limb with the suspected fracture so it does not move and circulation is not 
impaired. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Take body substance isolation precautions (BSI). 
 2. Prepare the casualty for the application of the splint. 
 
a. Upper extremity injury. 
 
(1) Have the casualty sit up. 
 
(2) Have someone support the fractured extremity. 
 
(3) Remove all jewelry from the fractured extremity. 
 
(4) Expose the fracture site. 
 
b. Lower extremity injury. 
 
(1) Have the casualty sit or lie down. 
 
(2) Have another person manually immobilize the fractured extremity. 
 
(3) Remove the foot gear and expose the fracture site. 
WARNING: If a pulse cannot be palpated, apply gentle manual traction in line with the long axis 
of the limb. This maneuver may restore the pulse. If a pulse does not return after one attempt, 
splint the limb in the most comfortable position for the casualty and evacuate the casualty 
immediately. 
 3. Check distal pulse and capillary refill on the injured extremity. 
 4. Prepare the splint for application. 
NOTE: If using a formable splint, measure and shape the splint on the uninjured extremity. 
 
a. Forearm/wrist fracture. 
 
(1) Fold the formable splint in half, upon itself creating a double layered splint, leaving 
one side approximately 1 inch longer than the other. 
 
(2) Take the folded end of the formable splint and roll at least two times towards the side 
with the shortest end. This will provide a natural curvature for the hand when the splint is 
applied. 
 
(3) Shape the formable splint into a C curve along the long axis from the rolled end to 
the opposite end. 
 
(4) Shape the splint until the splint generally conforms to the curve and shape of the limb 
being splinted. 
 
(5) Pad the splint and fill in the voids as needed. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-243 
 
b. Elbow injury. 
 
(1) The injured extremity should be placed in a V (bent) position with the forearm across 
the anterior thorax. 
 
(2) Take one splint and fold it in half, creating a double layered splint. After folding the 
splint in half make a C curve along the long axis of the splint. 
 
(3) Take another formable splint and fold it in half. 
 
(4) After folding the second formable splint in half, fold the splint in half again but along 
the long axis of the splint. 
 
(5) Pad the formable splint if needed. 
 
c. Fractured humerus. 
 
(1) Fold one third of the 36 inch formable splint upon itself to create a 12 inch section of 
double-layered splint. 
 
(2) Bend the double layered portion of the splint into a J and tape both layers together. 
 
(3) Fold the rest of the splint into a slight C, along the long axis of the splint, to create 
rigidity. 
 
d. Ankle injury. 
 
(1) Apply padding to the bony prominence of the medial and lateral ankle bones (medial 
and lateral malleolus). 
 
(2) Fold a 36 inch formable splint to create two equal halves. 
NOTE: When folding the formable splint, make sure that the middle fold is large enough to 
accommodate the foot. 
 
(3) Fold both sides of the splint in a slight C to create rigidity along the long axis of the 
splint. 
 
e. Tibia/fibula fracture. 
 
(1) Apply padding to the bony prominence of the medial and lateral ankle bones (medial 
and lateral malleolus). 
 
(2) Completely extend the entire 36 inch formable splint. 
 
(3) Curve approximately six inches of the splint into a J shape. 
 
(4) Form a C curve along the long axis of the remaining 30 inches of the splint. 
 
(5) Perform the same steps to another 36 inch formable splint. 
 5. Prepare cravats. 
NOTE: If cravats are to be used in securing the splint to the injured extremity, position the 
cravats above and below the fracture site. 
 6. Apply and secure the splint to the injured extremity with the limb in the position of function. 
 
a. Forearm/wrist fracture. 
 
(1) Place the fractured forearm in the splint with the hand in a natural curve on top of the 
rolled end of the splint. 
 
(2) Tie one cravat proximal to the fracture site and one cravat distal to the fracture site. 
 
(3) Tie the tails of the cravats in non-slip knot on the outside of the splint.

(4) Recheck the casualty's pulse and capillary refill below the most distal cravat. Loosen 
the cravats and reapply the splint if needed. 
 
(5) Cut the tails of each cravat to prevent accidental entanglement when the casualty is 
moved. 
 
(6) Apply and sling and swathe to further immobile the fractured arm. (See task 081-8330265.) 
 
b. Elbow injury. 
 
(1) While the arm is in the bent slight V position across the anterior thorax, place the 
formable splint that is folded in half along the long axis on the outside of the arm from the 
humerus to the forearm. 
 
(2) Place the formable splint that is bent into a C curve on the inside of the arm, also 
running from the humerus to the forearm. 
 
(3) The splint should extend approximately two inches past the forearm and two inches 
past the humerus. 
 
(4) Tie both splints together with one cravat in the middle area of the anterior elbow 
crease. The injured extremity should still be sandwiched between both formable splints. 
 
(5) Tie a cravat around both formable splints on the outside of the humerus. 
 
(6) Tie a cravat around both formable splints just past the forearm. 
 
(7) Apply a sling and swathe to further immobilize the fractured arm. (See task 081-8330265.) 
 
c. Fractured humerus. 
 
(1) Support the casualty’s arm in an L shape. 
 
(2) Hook the elbow with the J portion of the splint, running the rest of the splint along the 
upper arm towards the shoulder (on the outside of the arm). 
 
(3) Fold any excess splint that may be extending above the top of the shoulder, back 
upon itself (double layer). 
 
(4) Secure the splint with an elastic bandage distal to proximal and secure the elastic 
bandage with tape. 
 
(5) Apply a sling and swathe to further immobilize the fractured arm. (See task 081-8330265.) 
 
d. Ankle injury. 
 
(1) Apply the splint to the ankle by placing the foot in the stirrup portion of the splint. 
 
(2) Form the splint to the length of the lower leg. 
 
(3) Secure the splint by wrapping the elastic bandage from the top of the foot, around the 
bottom of the foot and up the length of the splint. 
 
(4) Tape the wrap in place. 
 
e. Tibia/fibula fracture. 
 
(1) Apply the splint to the outside area of the fractured tibia/fibula. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

(2) Place the foot in the J portion of the splint and run the long axis of the splint up the 
leg toward the knee. 
 
(3) Apply the second splint to the inside area of the fractured tibia/fibula. 
 
(4) Place the foot (with the previous splint) into the J and run the long axis of the splint 
up the leg toward the knee. 
 
(5) Wrap both splints around the lower leg with an elastic bandage starting from the top 
of the foot, around the bottom of the foot and then up the length of the splints toward the knee. 
 
(6) Tape the wrap in place. 
 7. Recheck distal pulse. 
NOTE: Recheck the distal pulse periodically to ensure that the swelling has not compromised 
the extremity. If swelling occurs and the distal pulse is lost, evacuate the casualty immediately. 
 8. Record treatment given on the appropriate medical form. 
 9. Evacuate the casualty. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: Provide a Soldier to act as a casualty. Have the formable splints and all materials for 
securing the splints and immobilizing the fractures available.

Apply an Elastic Bandage 
081-833-0264 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You have a patient needing an elastic bandage applied. You will need roller 
bandages, adhesive tape, and scissors. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Select and apply an appropriate bandage and wrap without causing further injury to 
the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Select the appropriate bandaging material for the injury. 
NOTE: The width of the bandage to use is determined by the size of the part to be covered. As 
a general rule, the larger the part or area, the wider the bandage. 
 
a. Use gauze or a flex roller for bleeding injuries of the forearm, upper arm, thigh, and lower 
leg. 
 
b. Use a flexible roller gauze bandage for bleeding injuries of the hand, wrist, elbow, 
shoulder, groin, knee, ankle, and foot. 
 
c. Use an elastic roller bandage for amputations, arterial bleeding, sprains, and torn 
muscles. 
 
(1) Hand-2 inch bandage. 
 
(2) Lower arm, lower leg, and foot-3 inch bandage. 
 
(3) Thigh and chest-4 to 6 inch bandage. 
NOTE: Elastic roller bandages may be used wherever pressure support or restriction of 
movement is needed. They should not be used to secure dressings. 
 2. Prepare the patient for bandaging. 
 
a. Position the body part to be bandaged in a normal resting position (position of function). 
NOTE: Bending a bandaged joint changes the pressure of the bandage in places of stress 
(elbow, knee, and ankle). 
 
b. Ensure that the body part to be bandaged is clean and dry. 
 
c. Place pads over bony places or between skin surfaces to be bandaged (such as fingers 
and armpits). 
CAUTION: Do not wrap too tightly. The roller bandage may act as a tourniquet on an injured 
limb, causing further damage. 
 3. Apply the anchor wrap. 
 
a. Lay the bandage end at an angle across the area to be bandaged. 
 
b. Bring the bandage under the area, back to the starting point, and make a second turn. 
 
c. Fold the uncovered triangle of the bandage end back over the second turn. 
 
d. Cover the triangle with a third turn, completing the anchor. 
 4. Apply the bandage wrap to the injury. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-247 
 
a. Use a circular wrap to end other bandage patterns, such as a pressure bandage, or to 
cover small dressings. 
 
b. Use a spiral wrap for a large cylindrical area such as a forearm, upper arm, calf, or thigh. 
The spiral wrap is used to cover an area larger than a circular wrap can cover. 
 
c. Use a spiral reverse wrap to cover small to large conical areas, for example, from ankle 
to knee. 
 
d. Use a figure eight wrap to support or limit joint movement at the hand, elbow, knee, 
ankle, or foot. 
 
e. Use a spica wrap (same as the figure eight wrap) to cover a much larger area such as 
the hip or shoulder. 
 
f. Use a recurrent wrap for anchoring a dressing on fingers, the head, or on a stump. 
NOTE: Bandage width depends on the site: 1 inch wide for fingers and 3, 4, or 6 inches wide for 
the stump or head. 
 5. Check circulation after application of the bandage. 
 
a. Check the pulse distal to the injury. 
 
b. Check for capillary refill (<2 seconds is normal), if applicable. 
 
c. Inspect the skin below the bandaging for discoloration. 
 
d. Ask the patient if any numbness, coldness, or tingling sensations are felt in the 
bandaged part. 
 
e. Remove and reapply the bandage, if necessary. 
 6. Check for irritation. 
 
a. Ask the patient if the bandage rubs. 
 
b. Check for bandage wrinkles near the skin surface. 
 
c. Check for red skin or sores (ulcers) when the bandage is removed. 
 
d. Remove and reapply the bandage, if necessary. 
 7. Elevate injured extremities to reduce swelling (edema) and control bleeding, if appropriate. 
 8. Record the treatment given on the appropriate medical form. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the patient. Tell the patient not 
to assist in any way. Provide the necessary elastic bandage and tape for the Soldier and 
designate the part the Soldier should apply the elastic bandage to. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to apply the elastic bandage.

Apply a Traction Splint 
081-833-0141 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You encounter a casualty with a suspected femur fracture. All other more serious 
injuries have been assessed and treated. You must apply a traction splint; another Soldier is 
available to assist you. You will need a traction splint, long spine board, securing devices, 
padding material, and DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Apply the traction splint without restricting circulation. Immobilize the fracture and 
maintain traction throughout the procedure, minimizing the effects of the injury. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Check for signs of a femur fracture. With unresponsive casualties, you should attempt to 
identify the mechanism of injury (MOI). 
 
a. Inspect the extremity for deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures or penetrations, 
burns, tenderness, lacerations, and swelling (DCAP-BTLS). 
WARNING: Do not use a traction splint for an injury close to or involving the knee, injury of the 
hip or pelvis, partial amputations or avulsions with bone separation, or lower leg or ankle injury. 
 
b. Palpate for tenderness, instability, or crepitus (TIC) in the extremity. 
 2. Expose the injured leg. For example cut the trouser leg if necessary. 
 3. Assess the circulation, sensation, and motor function (CSM). 
 4. Direct the assistant to manually support and stabilize the injured leg. 
 5. Measure the traction splint on the uninjured leg. Place the traction splint beside the 
casualty's uninjured leg and adjust to the proper length. 
 
a. Place the ring at the ischial tuberosity (next to the casualty's iliac crest). 
 
b. Loosen the locking sleeve. 
 
c. Extend the splint 8 to 12 inches beyond the casualty's foot. 
 
d. Tighten the locking sleeve. 
 
e. Open and adjust the four Velcro support straps, which should be positioned at the midthigh, above the knee, below the knee, and above the ankle. 
 6. Apply the ankle hitch about the casualty's ankle and foot. 
 
a. Thread the ankle hitch under the casualty's ankle at the void created by the heel. 
 
b. Place the lower edge of the ankle hitch even with the bottom of the heel. 
 
c. Crisscross the side straps high on the instep. 
 
d. Bring the crisscrossed straps down to meet the center strap and hold them in place. 
CAUTION: Apply only enough traction to align the limb to fit into the splint. Do not attempt to 
align the fracture fragments anatomically. Once manual traction has been applied, it must 
remain constant until the traction splint has been put in place and is providing traction. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-250 
 
3 May 2013 
 7. Direct the assistant to manually apply gentle longitudinal (in-line) traction to the ankle hitch 
and foot, while you support the leg at the site of the suspected injury (one hand above the site 
and one hand below the site) to support the fracture as traction is pulled and the leg is lifted. 
 8. Place the splint into position by sliding the splint under the injured leg. 
NOTE: While applying gentle traction, the assistant may lift the casualty's leg far enough to fit 
the splint into place. 
 
a. Pull the release ring on the ratchet and release the traction strap. 
 
b. Move the splint between the assistant's legs so that it is aligned with the casualty's 
injured leg. 
 
c. Move one hand from the fracture site and pull the splint from between the assistant's 
legs. 
 
d. Slide the splint under the leg until the ischial ring is at the buttock. 
NOTE: Make sure the splint is aligned with the leg. 
 
e. When the splint is in place, position the hand back under the fracture site for stabilization 
only. 
 
f. On the assistant's signal, lower the leg into the cradle of the splint while maintaining 
manual traction. 
 
g. Extend and position the heel stand after the splint is in position under the leg. 
 9. Pad the groin area (cravat, Kerlix®, etc.) and fasten the ischial strap. 
 10. Apply mechanical traction. 
 
a. Attach the rings from the ankle hitch to the "S" hook from the splint. 
 
b. Tighten the ratchet mechanism by turning it clockwise. 
 
c. Direct the assistant to alert you when mechanical traction is equal to their manual 
traction. 
NOTE: Adequate traction has been applied when the injured leg is the same length as the other 
leg or the casualty feels relief. 
 11. Secure the Velcro® support straps. Direct the assistant to maintain manual stabilization 
until all four support straps are secure. 
 12. Reevaluate the ischial strap and ankle hitch. 
 13. Reassess the CSM. 
 14. Place the casualty securely on a long spine board to immobilize the hip. 
 15. Secure the splint to the long spine board to prevent movement of the splint (strapping, 
tape, etc.). 
 16. Document the procedure on a FMC. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the casualty. You will need 
another Soldier to act as an assistant. Describe a scenario that involves a femur fracture 
(parachute or vehicle accident, etc.). Tell the assisting Soldier to only perform those actions the 
Soldier being evaluated directs. 
CAUTION: Do not allow the Soldiers to apply full traction to the casualty.

casualty’s arm is placed in a sling, a swath can be used to hold the arm against the side of the 
chest. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Assess distal circulation, sensation, and motor (CSM) functions of the extremity. 
 2. Prepare the sling by folding cloth into a triangle. 
NOTE: A triangular bandage makes an ideal arm sling. 
 3. Fold the injured arm across the casualty's chest. 
NOTE: If casualty cannot hold their arm, have someone assist them until you tie the sling. 
 4. Position the sling over the top of the casualty’s chest. 
 5. Extend one point of the triangle beyond the elbow on the injured side. 
 
a. Take the bottom point and bring it up over the casualty’s arm. 
 
b. Continue to take it over the top of the injured shoulder. 
 
c. If appropriate, draw up the ends of the sling so that the casualty’s hand is about 4 inches 
above the elbow. 
CAUTION: If a spinal injury is suspected, do not tie the sling around the casualty's neck, 
instead, pin the ends to the casualty's clothing securely. 
 6. Tie the two ends of the sling together. 
 
a. Make sure that the knot does not press against the back of the casualty’s neck. 
 
b. Pad with bulky dressings. 
 
c. Confirm the casualty's fingertips are left exposed. 
 7. Assess distal CSM. 
 
a. If the pulse has been lost, take off the sling and repeat the procedure. 
 
b. If procedure was repeated, recheck CSM. 
 8. Form a pocket for the casualty’s elbow. 
 
a. Take hold of the point of material at the elbow and fold it forward, pinning it to the front of 
the sling. 
 
b. If you do not have a pin, twist the excess material and tie a knot in the point. 
 9. Form a swath from a second piece of material by tying it around the chest and the injured 
arm, over the sling. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

Provide Care for a Casualty with a Suspected Spinal Injury 
081-833-0267 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You encounter a casualty with a suspected spinal injury. All other more serious 
injuries have been assessed and treated. Three other Soldiers are available for assistance. You 
have taken BSI (body substance isolation) precautions. You will need straps, cravats, long and 
short spine boards, immobilization vest-type device, cervical collar or materials to improvise a 
cervical collar, padding materials, towels, blankets, head supports, pen and DD Form 1380 US 
Field Medical Card (FMC). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Complete all of the steps necessary to immobilize a casualty with a suspected 
spinal injury and prepare him for transport without causing additional injury to the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Inform casualty to not move and explain procedure prior to performing. 
NOTE: An important factor to consider in the casualty with a possible spine injury is the mental 
status. 
 2. Provide manual in-line stabilization. 
 
a. Ask one of the Soldiers available for assistance. 
WARNING: Manual in-line stabilization should not be released until the casualty is immobilized 
onto the long spine board. 
 
b. Instruct Soldier to manually hold in-line spinal stabilization and to not let go. 
NOTE: In-line neutral position that is, the casualty’s head should be facing forward and not 
turned to either side nor tilted forward or backward. You must be careful not to pull or twist the 
casualty’s head but rather to hold it perfectly still and to remind the casualty not to try to move 
it.WARNING: If you suspect the casualty has a spinal injury, you must treat him as though he 
has a spinal injury; when in doubt, immobilize. 
 3. Check for the signs and symptoms of a spinal injury. With unresponsive casualties, you 
should attempt to identify the mechanism of injury (MOI). 
 
a. If possible, inspect the spine for deformities, contusions, abrasions, punctures or 
penetrations, burns, tenderness, lacerations, and swelling (DCAP-BTLS). 
 
b. Lacerations and/or contusions in the spinal region indicate severe trauma and usually 
accompany a spinal injury. 
 
c. Palpate for tenderness, instability, or crepitus (TIC) in the spinal region. 
NOTE: The ability to walk, move the extremities, feel sensation, and the absence of pain does 
not necessary rule out a spinal cord injury. 
 
(1) Carefully insert your hand under the casualty's neck and palpate along the cervical 
spine as far as can be done without moving the casualty. 
 
(2) Carefully insert your hand into the area of the small of the back and palpate along the 
thoracic spine and down the lumbar spine as far as possible without moving the casualty. 
 
d. Check for weakness, loss of sensation, paresthesia (tingling), and/or paralysis. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-261 
 
(1) A cervical spine injury may cause numbness or paralysis in all four extremities. 
 
(2) A waist level (thoracic) spinal injury may cause numbness or paralysis below the 
waist. 
 
(3) Ask the casualty to try to move his fingers and toes to check for motor function. 
 4. Immobilize a sitting casualty using a short spine board. 
 
a. Have your assistant carefully move the casualty's head into a proper, neutral in-line 
position. Continue manual stabilization until the casualty is secured to a long spine board. 
Whenever possible, kneel behind the casualty and place hands around the base of the skull on 
either side. Careful movement of the head and neck into a neutral position must be stopped if 
movement results in any of the following. 
 
(1) Neck muscle spasm. 
 
(2) Increased pain. 
 
(3) Increase in numbness, tingling, or loss of motor ability. 
 
(4) Compromise of the airway or ventilation. 
 
b. In these situations, the casualty's head must be immobilized in the position in which it 
was initially found. 
 
c. Stabilize the head and neck. 
 
(1) Place your hands on both sides of the casualty's skull, with the palms above the ears. 
 
(2) Support the jaw (mandible) with the fingers. 
 
(3) Maintain manual stabilization until directed to release the stabilization. 
 
d. Assess circulation, motor, and sensory function (CMS). 
 
e. Apply a rigid cervical collar, if available, or improvise one. 
NOTE: Measure the rigid cervical collar according to the manufacturer's specifications. (See 
task 081-833-0177.) An improperly sized device has a potential for further injury. 
 
f. Push the board as far into the area behind the casualty as possible. 
 
g. Tilt the upper end of the board toward the head. 
 
h. Direct the assistant to position the back of the casualty's head against the board, 
maintaining manual in-line stabilization, by moving the head and neck as one unit. 
NOTE: If the cervical collar or improvised collar does not fit flush with the spine board, place a 
roll in the hollow space between the neck and board. The roll should only be large enough to fill 
the gap, not to exert pressure on the neck. 
 
i. Secure the short spine board to the casualty's torso. 
 
(1) Place the buckle of the first strap in the casualty's lap. 
 
(2) Pass the other end of the strap through the lower hole in the board, up the back of 
the board, through the top hole, under the armpit, over the shoulder, and across the back of the 
board at the neck. 
 
(3) Buckle the second strap to the first strap and place the buckle on the side of the 
board at the neck. 
 
(4) Pass the other end over the shoulder, under the armpit, through the top hole in the 
board, down the back of the board, through the lower hole, and across the lap. Secure it by 
buckling it to the first strap.

j. Secure the casualty's head and head supports to the board with straps or cravats. 
WARNING: Ensure that the cravats or head straps are firmly in place before the assistant 
releases stabilization. 
 
(1) Apply head supports. 
 
(2) Use two rolled towels, blankets, or similar material. 
 
(3) Place one close to each side of the head. 
 
(4) Using a cravat-like material across the forehead, make the supports and head one 
unit by tying to the board. 
 
k. Reassess CMS. 
 
l. Tie the casualty's hands together and place them in his lap. 
NOTE: When positioning a casualty who is secured to a short spine board, on a long spine 
board, line up the hand grip holes of the short spine board with the holes of the long spine 
board, if possible, and secure the two boards together with straps. 
 5. Immobilize a sitting casualty using a vest-type device, such as a kendrick extrication device 
(KED). 
 
a. Stabilize and assess the sitting casualty as in steps 4a through 4e. 
NOTE: Before placing the vest-type device behind the casualty, the two long straps (groin 
straps) are unfastened and placed behind the device. 
 
b. Position the immobilization device behind the casualty. The side flaps are placed around 
the casualty's torso and moved until they are in contact with the casualty's armpits. 
 
c. Secure the vest-type device to the casualty's torso. 
 
(1) Immobilize the torso, beginning with the middle strap, followed by the lower strap and 
finally the upper strap. Tighten each strap after attachment. 
 
(2) Position and tighten each groin strap; ensure you pad the groin area. 
CAUTION: The straps must be tight enough so the device does not move up, down, left or right 
excessively, but not so tight as to restrict the casualty’s breathing. 
 
d. Secure the casualty's head to the vest-type device. 
 
(1) Pad behind the casualty's head as necessary. 
 
(2) Place the first strap or cravat across the chin angling upward toward the ear. Attach 
to the head flaps on either side of the head. Ensure the strap/cravat does not interfere with the 
airway. 
 
(3) Place the second strap or cravat across the forehead angling downward toward the 
base of the head. Attach to the head flaps on either side of the head. 
NOTE: The pelvic straps must be released after being placed on a long spine board in order to 
place the casualty in a supine position. 
 6. Place the casualty on a long spine board. 
NOTE: If a long spine board is not available, utilize a standard litter or improvised litter made 
from a board or door. A hard surface is preferable to one that gives with the casualty's weight. 
 
a. The log-roll technique. 
 
(1) Position the long spine board next to, and parallel with, the casualty. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-263 
 
(2) Maintain manual stabilization of the casualty's head and neck. This individual will 
direct all movements while maintaining in-line support of the head and neck. 
 
 
(a) Spread your fingers and thumbs around the sides of the casualty's head to hold it 
steady. 
 
 
(b) Support the jaw (mandible) with the fingers. 
 
 
(c) Maintain manual stabilization until the casualty has been placed on the spine 
board. 
 
(3) Apply a cervical collar, if available, or improvise one. 
 
(4) Brief each of the three assistants on their duties and instruct them to kneel on the 
same side of the casualty, with the long spine board on the opposite side of the casualty. 
 
 
(a) First assistant. Place the near hand on the shoulder and the far hand on the waist. 
 
 
(b) Second assistant. Place the near hand on the hip and the far hand on the thigh. 
 
 
(c) Third assistant. Place the near hand on the knee and the far hand on the ankle. 
 
(5) On the command of the team leader stabilizing the casualty's head, and in unison, 
the assistants roll the casualty slightly toward them. The head and neck must be maintained inline with the casualty's spine during all movements. 
 
(6) Instruct the assistants to reach across the casualty with one hand, grasp the spine 
board at its closest edge, and slide it against the casualty. Instruct the number two assistant to 
reach across the board to the far edge and hold it in place to prevent board movement. 
 
(7) Instruct the assistants to slowly roll the casualty back onto the board, keeping the 
head and spine in a straight line. 
 
(8) Reassess CMS. 
 
b. The straddle-slide technique. 
NOTE: Use this method when limited space makes it impossible to use the log roll technique. 
 
(1) Stand (team leader) at the head of the casualty with your feet wide apart. 
 
(2) Apply stabilization to the casualty's head and apply a cervical collar, if available, or 
improvise one. 
 
(3) Instruct the first assistant to stand behind you (facing your back), to line up the spine 
board, and to gently slide the spine board under the casualty at your command. 
 
(4) Instruct the second assistant to straddle the casualty while facing you and gently 
elevate the shoulders so that the spine board can be slid under them. 
 
(5) Instruct the third assistant (facing you) to carefully elevate the hips while the spine 
board is being slid under the casualty. 
WARNING: Complete all movements simultaneously, keeping the head and spine in a straight 
line. 
 
(6) Instruct the fourth assistant (facing you) to carefully elevate the legs and ankles while 
the board is being slid into place under the casualty. 
NOTE: If the cervical collar or improvised collar does not fit flush with the spine board, place a 
roll in the hollow space between the neck and board. The roll should only be large enough to fill 
the gap, not to exert pressure on the neck. 
 7. Secure the casualty to the long spine board. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-264 
 
3 May 2013 
 
a. While maintaining manual stabilization, secure the torso to the long spine board by 
applying straps across chest, pelvis, and legs. Adjust these straps as needed. 
 
b. While continuing to maintain manual stabilization, apply the head supports to each side 
of the casualty's head. 
 
c. Fasten a strap or cravat-like material tightly over the head supports and the lower 
forehead. A second strap/cravat is placed over the pads and the rigid cervical collar and is 
fastened securely to the long board. 
 
d. Reassess CMS. 
 8. Record the treatment on the FMC. 
 9. Evacuate the casualty. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the casualty. You will need three 
Soldiers to act as the assistants. The Soldier being tested is to act as the team leader and direct 
the actions of the assistants. The casualty may be placed in a vehicle or other scenario, 
depending on available resources and the technique you are testing. Tell the assisting Soldiers 
to only perform those actions the Soldier being evaluated directs. 
Brief Soldier: To test step 3, tell the Soldier to state the signs and symptoms of a spinal injury. 
Tell the Soldier that the casualty has a suspected spinal injury. Then tell the Soldier to position 
the casualty on a spine board and to direct the actions of the assistants.

Immobilize the Pelvis 
081-833-0266 
WARNING: Certain pelvic fractures can cause significant internal hemorrhaging. Many times 
when casualties experience pelvic fractures, there are also significant internal injuries to the 
organs protected by the pelvis. Hemodynamic stability and rapid transport should be a main 
consideration when treating these types of casualties. 
Conditions: You have a casualty with a suspected dislocated or fractured hip or pelvis. You 
need to immobilize the hip and pelvis. Three other Soldiers are available to assist you. You will 
need a litter, cravats or commercial straps, padding material, spine board or other rigid object, 
pneumatic anti-shock garment (PASG) or a pelvic binder device (pelvic sling) and a scoop 
stretcher. You are not in a CBRN environment. You have taken body substance isolation (BSI). 
Standards: Immobilize a suspected dislocated or fractured hip or pelvis without impairing 
circulation or causing further injury to the casualty. 
NOTE: Pain control should be considered early when managing hip or pelvic injuries. 
Performance Steps 
CAUTION: Both a dislocated and a fractured hip or pelvis are accompanied by considerable 
pain. The casualty will resist any movement because of pain. It is essential that medical 
personnel take all possible precautions, using the best available materials at hand while 
preparing the casualty to be immediately evacuated. 
 1. Check for the signs and symptoms of a hip or pelvic injury. 
 
a. Anterior hip dislocation. 
NOTE: Anterior dislocation is very rare and is caused by the legs suddenly being forced widely 
apart and locked in this position. 
 
(1) Hip pain. 
 
(2) Severe deformity of the affected leg. 
 
 
(a) The knee is turned outward. 
 
 
(b) The affected leg is shortened. 
 
 
(c) The hip is drawn away from the midline of the body. 
 
 
(d) The leg has rotated away from the midline of the body. 
 
(3) Impaired circulation in the affected extremity. 
 
 
(a) Loss of pulse distal to the injury. 
 
 
(b) Coolness and/or cyanosis. 
 
 
(c) Swelling due to internal blood loss. 
WARNING: Significant blood loss may occur before swelling is evident. Take the casualty's vital 
signs as soon as possible and monitor them during stabilization and transport. 
 
 
(d) Hypovolemic shock. 
 
(4) Impaired sensation in the affected extremity. 
 
 
(a) Tingling or other abnormal sensations (paresthesia). 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-270 
 
3 May 2013 
 
 
(b) Loss of sensation. 
 
b. Posterior hip dislocation. 
NOTE: Posterior dislocation is the most common type of hip dislocation. 
 
(1) Hip pain. 
 
(2) Severe deformity of the affected leg. 
 
 
(a) The hip joint is flexed with the knee drawn up. 
 
 
(b) The hip is drawn toward the midline of the body. 
 
 
(c) The leg has rotated toward the midline of the body. 
 
(3) Impaired circulation in the affected extremity. 
 
 
(a) Loss of pulse distal to the injury. 
 
 
(b) Coolness and/or cyanosis. 
 
 
(c) Swelling due to internal blood loss. 
 
(4) Impaired sensation in the affected extremity. 
 
 
(a) Paresthesia. 
 
 
(b) Loss of sensation. 
NOTE: Weakness of muscles that raise the foot may occur. This condition, known as "foot 
drop," may be a sign of damage to the sciatic nerve. 
 
c. Hip fracture. 
NOTE: Some of the most common fractures are those that occur at the proximal (upper) end of 
the femur. These have been called "hip fractures" even though the hip joint is rarely involved. 
 
(1) Hip pain. 
 
(2) The casualty is unable to walk on or move the affected leg. 
 
(3) Deformity. 
 
 
(a) The affected leg has rotated toward the midline of the body. 
 
 
(b) The affected leg will usually be shorter than the uninjured one. 
NOTE: Fractures of the femur are often open. Whether closed or open, they are always 
associated with a loss of large amounts of blood. Therefore, you should treat the casualty with 
high-flow oxygen and monitor vital signs frequently, watching for signs of shock. 
 
(4) Impaired circulation in the affected extremity. 
 
 
(a) Loss of pulse in the femoral or popliteal arteries distal to the injury. 
 
 
(b) Coolness and/or cyanosis. 
 
 
(c) Swelling due to internal blood loss. 
 
(5) Impaired sensation in the affected extremity. 
 
 
(a) Paresthesia. 
 
 
(b) Loss of sensation. 
WARNING: Inspect the casualty’s pelvis prior to palpation. When palpating the casualty’s pelvis 
only gentle palpation should be used and the pelvis should only be palpated once. If upon 
physical inspection deformity, ecchymosis or edema is visible, palpation of the pelvis is not

3-271 
necessary and a pelvic fracture should be suspected. 
 
d. Pelvic fractures. 
NOTE: There are three types of pelvic fractures, rami fractures, acetabular fractures and pelvic 
ring fractures. Pelvic ring fractures usually involve massive hemorrhage and are considered a 
life threat. 
 
(1) Pain. 
 
(2) Deformity. 
 
(3) Ecchymosis. 
 2. Check for circulation in the affected leg(s) by checking the femoral and popliteal pulses and 
observing for swelling or cyanosis. 
 3. Check for impaired sensation by asking the casualty if he has tingling, abnormal 
sensations, or loss of sensation in the affected limb. 
CAUTION: Do not log roll a casualty with a hip injury onto the injured side. If available, place the 
casualty on a spine board using a scoop litter. 
 4. Immobilize the injury. 
 
a. Hip dislocations. 
 
(1) Place the casualty on a long spine board. (See task 081-833-0181.) 
 
(2) Support the leg in its abnormal position using pillows, blankets, or similar material. 
 
(3) Secure the support material with cravats. 
 
b. Hip fracture. 
 
(1) Place the casualty on a long spine board. 
 
(2) Place support material under the buttocks to reduce abdominal pain only if there are 
no other major fractures in the lower extremities. 
 
(3) Place bulky support material between the casualty's legs and strap them together. 
 
(4) Place bulky support material underneath the knees. 
 
c. Pelvic fracture. 
 
(1) Place pnueumatic anti-shock garment (PASG), on long spine board. 
 
(2) Gently apply the scoop stretcher to the casualty. 
 
(3) Move the casualty (on the scoop stretcher) to the long spine board and remove the 
scoop stretcher. 
 
(4) Wrap and secure the PASG to the casualty (do not inflate). 
NOTE: The PASG is applied but not inflated until the casualty shows signs of hemodynamic 
instability (class III or IV shock). If PASGs are not available, a pelvic binder device or sheet 
should be applied. 
 
(5) The lower extremities should be adducted and internally rotated. 
 
(6) Secure the casualty to the long spine board. 
 5. Check for complications. 
 
a. Impaired circulation in the affected limb. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-272 
 
3 May 2013 
 
b. Neurological deficit. 
 
c. Hypovolemic shock. 
WARNING: Spontaneous reduction of dislocation may occur during any movement. This may 
be accompanied by additional damage to nerves and blood vessels. The receiving facility must 
be informed if this occurs. 
 6. Record the treatment given on a FMC, aTCCC or a patient care report. 
WARNING: Avoid any bumping or jerking during transport. Excessive movement of a fracture or 
dislocation can increase blood loss and pain. Hip and leg injuries allow for a greater area of 
pooling of blood that is not evident early on, and may result in the casualty going in to 
hypovolemic shock. 
 7. Evacuate the casualty. 
 
a. Position the casualty and spine board on a litter. 
 
b. Load litter on evacuation platform. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaulation, use another Soldier as a simulated casualty and have three 
assistants availble to assist. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier the casualty has a suspected hip or pelvic injury that needs to be 
immobilized.

Treat Common Musculoskeletal Disorders 
081-833-0222 
Conditions: You have a patient who presents with a musculoskeletal complaint. You will need 
a shoulder sling, splint, ace wrap, crutches anti-inflammatory drugs, ice packs, and patient's 
medical record. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Treat common musculoskeletal or foot complaints without causing further harm to 
the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Review the patient's medical record, if available. 
 2. Obtain a history. 
 
a. O = onset. When did it start? What were you doing when it started? What was the 
position of the foot (inverted, supinated)? 
 
b. P = provocative and palliative factors. What makes it better? What makes it worse? Is 
there any pain without weight bearing? 
 
c. Q = quality. Is it sharp, dull, aching, pounding, constant, or intermittent? What is the 
character of the pain? 
 
d. R = region and radiation. Where exactly is the pain? Does it seem to spread anywhere 
or does it stay right there? Is there any involvement of other joints? 
 
e. S = severity. How bad is the pain? Is it incapacitating? Does it cause you to change 
your activity? 
 
f. T = time, temporal characteristics (duration). When does it hurt? How long does it last? 
Have you had prior episodes? Any history of trauma or prior surgery? 
 3. Manage cervical pain. 
 
a. Cervical strain. 
 
(1) A strain happens when a muscle-tendon unit is overloaded or stretched. 
 
(2) Motion of the neck becomes painful. 
 
(3) Peaks after several hours or the next day. 
 
(4) Treat with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), heat, massage, and other 
therapeutic modalities. 
 
b. Cervical sprain. 
 
(1) Movement is limited. 
 
(2) Ligamentous disruption may be extensive enough to result in instability with 
associated neurologic involvement. 
 
(3) Routine cervical spine radiographs are indicated. 
 
(4) Treatment of a cervical sprain consists of immobilization, rest, support, and NSAIDs. 
 
(5) Return to participation is permitted when motion and muscle strength normalize. 
 
c. Cervical fracture. Any patient suspected of cervical fracture or having any neurologic 
deficit as a result of a cervical injury requires x-rays and must be evaluated by a medical officer.

 4. Manage low back pain. 
 
a. Lumbosacral strain (mild to moderate). 
 
(1) Signs and symptoms. 
 
 
(a) Usually have reduced range of motion. 
 
 
(b) Discomfort which is localized to the lumbar-sacral area. 
 
 
(c) Palpable muscle tenderness/spasm. 
 
 
(d) Negative straight leg raise (SLR). 
 
(2) Treatment. Decrease activity and ice massages. Medications, if required, usually 
consist of anti-inflammatory drugs and/or muscle relaxants. Often obesity is a factor in low back 
pain and patients should be encouraged to lose weight. 
 5. Manage shoulder pain. 
 
a. Rotator cuff tear. 
 
(1) Usually presents with shoulder pain/tenderness. 
 
(2) History of trauma. 
 
(3) Patient is unable to abduct the arm or hold it abducted against gravity. 
 
(4) Treat initially with a shoulder sling and oral anti-inflammatory drugs (ASA, Motrin). 
Any shoulder complaint with a history of trauma must be referred to a medical officer. 
 
b. Impingement syndrome (shoulder pain). 
 
(1) Most common cause of shoulder pain and refers to mechanical compression and/or 
wear of the rotator cuff tendons. 
 
(2) Any process which compromises this normal gliding function may lead to mechanical 
impingement. 
 
(3) Most commonly seen in tennis players, pitchers and swimmers. 
 
(4) The first step in treating shoulder impingement is to eliminate any identifiable cause 
or contributing factor. 
 
(5) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication may be used. 
 
(6) The mainstay of treatment involves exercises to restore normal flexibility and strength 
to the shoulder girdle. 
 
c. Acute bursitis. 
 
(1) Usually produces pain with movement. 
 
(2) Follows overuse in most instances. 
 
(3) Most frequently tender to palpation over subdeltoid bursa. 
 
(4) Treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and progressive shoulder exercises. There 
should be a reduction of certain physical activities including lifting, pushups and pulling for 
seven7 days. 
 
d. Septic arthritis. 
 
(1) Should be considered if the patient has a fever or other signs and symptoms of 
inflammation. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-279 
 
(2) Emergent referral to a medical officer is indicated. 
 
e. Dislocation. 
 
(1) Usually follows a history of trauma but may occur spontaneously in some people. 
 
(2) Sudden onset of pain with gross deformity of shoulder joint. 
 
(3) Severe limitation of motion. 
 
(4) X-ray should be done to rule out (R/O) associated fracture if a history of trauma. 
Often deferred until after reduction in order not to delay. 
 
(5) Splint and assess distal pulses. 
 
(6) Prompt referral to a medical officer. 
 
(7) Pain medication and/or muscle relaxant may be used to relieve anxiety, pain and 
muscle spasm prior to reducing. 
 6. Manage knee pain. 
 
a. Septic knee joint. 
 
(1) Hot, tender knee with or without swelling. 
 
(2) Orthopedic emergency requiring referral to a medical officer. 
 
b. Sprain/strain. 
 
(1) Tenderness over medial collateral ligament (MCL) or lateral collateral ligament (LCL) 
without laxity may indicate grade I sprain or strain. 
 
(2) If mild laxity and tenderness of MCL/LCL is present, possible grade II sprain. 
 
(3) If ecchymosis, effusion present with laxity, possible grade III sprain (torn ligament). 
 
(4) Initial treatment consists of ice packs, ace wrap and elevation for the first 24 hours. 
Crutches may be indicated for comfort. Anti-inflammatory agents are used as required. 
 
c. Patellar dislocation. Gross instability of the patella indicates that injury to the soft tissues 
of the medial aspect of the knee has been extensive. 
 
(1) When dislocation of the patella occurs alone, it may be caused by a direct force or 
activity of the quadriceps, and the direction of dislocation of the patella is usually lateral. 
 
(2) Spontaneous reduction may occur if the knee joint is extended. 
 
(3) Initially treat with rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE), NSAID, profile, and 
crutches if unstable. Will need ortho referral to evaluate for arthroscopic surgery. 
 
d. Retropatellar (patellofemoral) pain syndrome. 
 
(1) ) The symptoms probably represent the majority of knee pain complaints in athletes. 
 
(2) Vague knee pain, which is usually after several hours of exercise. 
 
(3) Walking downhill or downstairs, bending at the knees, and kneeling exacerbates 
pain. 
 
(4) Initially treat with RICE, NSAID, stretches and exercises to strengthen quadriceps. 
Physical therapy consult for prolonged cases. 
 7. Manage foot pain.

analgesics (Motrin). An ace wrap is indicated with gradual increase of activity after 72 to 96 
hours. 
 
c. Grade III ankle sprain. 
 
(1) Unable to bear weight. 
 
(2) Edema. 
 
(3) Ecchymosis present. 
 
(4) Acute tenderness. 
 
(5) Positive drawer sign. 
 
(6) Neurovascular status may be compromised. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-281 
 
(7) Range of motion markedly reduced. 
 
(8) Should be referred to a MO for x-rays to be done to rule out an associated fracture. 
 
(9) Immobilization using either a splint or non-weight bearing cast. Initially, ice, 
compression, and elevation are used to reduce edema and pain. Crutches, without weight 
bearing, and follow-up with podiatry or orthopedics is usually indicated. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs or a mild narcotic will often be needed for pain relief. In all sprains, physical 
activity must be reduced appropriately and will vary in length from 72 hours to several weeks. 
 9. Manage achilles tendonitis. 
 
a. Pain, swelling, tenderness along tendon. 
 
b. Treat achilles tendonitis with RICE, NSAIDs, ice for twenty minutes after activity, heel lift, 
and crutches if severe.

Subject Area 8: CBRN 
Decontaminate a Casualty 
081-833-0095 
Conditions: You are supervising the contaminated side of an established chemical 
decontamination station. Medical personnel and nonmedical augmentees are in MOPP level 4. 
Chemically contaminated casualties have been triaged by the senior medic and have been 
routed to your area for decontamination. You will need a M258A1 or M291 decontamination kit, 
5% chlorine solution, 0. 5% chlorine solution, butyl rubber aprons, butyl rubber gloves, stainless 
steel buckets, cellulose sponges, water source, plastic bags, litters, litter stands, bandage 
scissors, M8 chemical detection paper, chemical agent monitor (CAM), contaminated disposal 
containers, bandages, gauze, combat application tourniquets (C-A-T) and DD Form 1380 US 
Field Medical Card (FMC). You are in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Remove the casualty's clothing without further contaminating the casualty or 
contaminating decontamination team personnel. Remove dressings, replace tourniquets, and 
decontaminate splints. Effectively decontaminate and transfer the casualty across the shuffle pit 
without contaminating the clean side of the hot line. 
NOTE: The supported unit must provide a minimum of 8 nonmedical personnel to augment the 
decontamination station as the decontamination team. Although casualty decontamination is 
routinely performed by these nonmedical personnel, the supervision of and final determination 
as to the completeness of the decontamination rests with medical personnel. 
 NOTE: Steps 1 through 17 will be performed by personnel in the clothing removal area. At the 
clothing removal area two to four persons will be working together as a team, one or two on 
either side of the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Decontaminate the casualty's hood. 
 
a. Cover the mask air inlets of the filter canister (C2A1) with a hand or gauze. Instruct the 
casualty to do this if he is able. 
 
b. Wipe off the voicemitter, eyelets, outserts and the hood using M291 SDK or 5% bleach 
solution (starting at the top of the head and wiping down towards the litter and shoulders). 
NOTE: The medical equipment set (MES) for chemical agent casualty decontamination contains 
powdered calcium hypochlorite (high test hypochlorite or HTH). It is mixed with water to make 
the 5% and 0. 5% decontaminating solutions. Liquid chlorine bleach (household bleach), a 5% 
solution of sodium hypochlorite, may also be used. 
 
c. Uncover the mask air inlets. 
 2. Cut off the casualty's hood. 
 
a. Remove the quick-doff hood of the M40 mask. 
 
(1) Dip cutting tools and gloved hands in the 5% solution. 
 
(2) Cut the hood shoulder straps. 
NOTE: After every complete segmental cut, the cutting tools are decontaminated, along with the 
gloved hands of the Soldier doing the cutting. Do this by dipping gloved hands and cutting tools 
in a bucket of 5% bleach, or if ample supplies of the M295 or, M291 are available, and water is 
limited, these can be used to scrub the cutting tools. 
 
(3) Cut the neck cord, hood straps and drawstring. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-284 
 
3 May 2013 
 
(4) Cut the quick-doff hood from the front bottom center to the chin through the elastic 
band under the chin. 
 
(5) Cut the hood straps that connect hood to the mask. 
 
(6) Finally, cut from the center of the forehead, over the top of the head toward the litter, 
so that the hood will lay flat on the litter. 
 
b. Remove the hood of the Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology (JSLIST). 
 
(1) Dip the cutting device in a bucket of 5% bleach solution or decon/scrub-cutting tool 
with the M295 or M291. 
 
(2) Cut the hood starting at the front center and continue cutting across the top of the 
head toward the litter. 
 
(3) Fold the left and right sides of the hood away from the head on the litter. 
 3. Decontaminate the casualty's mask and exposed skin. 
 
a. Use soap and water, M291 skin decontamination kit, or 0. 5% bleach solution. 
CAUTION: Use only the 0. 5% solution to decontaminate the skin and the parts of the mask that 
touch the face. The 5% solution is corrosive and may burn the skin. 
 
b. Cover the port of filter canister to prevent wetting or congesting. 
 
c. Decontaminate the exterior of the mask. 
 
d. Wipe any exposed areas of Soldier’s face that were not protected by the hood (i.e. chin, 
neck, and back of ears). 
 
e. Uncover the mask air inlets. 
 4. Remove the casualty's FMC. 
NOTE: The medic at the litter patient decontamination station should view the FMC prior to 
removal.

Set Up a Casualty Decontamination Station 
081-833-0093 
Conditions: You are assigned to a division level medical facility battalion aid station (BAS) or 
division clearing station (DCS). Chemical agents are being used against the units supported by 
your medical treatment facility. The commander has ordered that a decontamination station and 
protective shelter be established. Your current location is in a non-contaminated area, upwind 
from the chemical hazard. You are in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Set up a fully operational patient decontamination station (PDS) in a noncontaminated area upwind from the chemical hazard. Establish the decontamination area on the 
downwind side of the protective shelter or other clean treatment area and clearly mark a hot 
line. Construct a shuffle pit as the only point of access to the clean areas. Install chemical agent 
alarms. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Select sites for the location of the operation. 
 
a. Relate and alternate sites must be selected in advance of operations. 
NOTE: Alternate sites must be selected in conjunction with selection of the primary site. If the 
prevailing winds change direction by more than 30 degrees, use of the primary site may no 
longer be possible. A wait of 10 to 15 minutes to determine if the change is permanent should 
precede the move. When the station is moved, it must be moved at least 75 meters upwind from 
any contaminated area. 
 
b. Site selection factors. 
 
(1) The direction of the prevailing winds. 
 
(2) The downwind chemical hazard. 
 
(3) The availability of protective shelters or buildings to house clean treatment facilities. 
 
(4) The terrain. 
 
(5) Availability of cover and concealment. 
NOTE: The protective shelter may possess visual, audible, and infrared signatures. Therefore, 
concealment may be compromised. 
 
(6) The general tactical situation. 
 
(7) The availability of evacuation routes (contaminated and clean). 
 
(8) The location of the supported unit's vehicle decontamination point, personnel 
decontamination point, and MOPP exchange point. 
NOTE: It is sometimes best to co-locate with these unit decontamination sites. The arrangement 
of the operational areas must be kept flexible and adaptable to both the medical and tactical 
situations. 
 2. Set up the decontamination area. (See Figure 3-6.)

3 May 2013 
 
Figure 3-6. Decontamination area 
 
a. Triage area. 
 
b. Emergency treatment area. 
NOTE: Sometimes, triage and emergency treatment are conducted in the same area. 
 
c. Clothing removal area. 
 
d. Skin decontamination area. 
 
e. Overhead cover. 
 
(1) Erect an overhead cover, at least 20 x 50 feet, to cover the decontamination area 
and the clean waiting and treatment area. If the protective shelter is used, the overhead cover 
should overlap the air lock entrance. 
 
(2) If plastic sheeting is not available, alternate materials such as trailer covers, ponchos, 
or tarpaulins may be used. 
 3. Set up the clean side of the decontamination station on the upwind side of the 
contaminated areas. 
NOTE: Erect a windsock for easy determination of wind direction. 
 
a. Clean waiting area. 
 
b. Clean treatment area. 
 4. Set up the shuffle pit as the only point of access between the decontamination area and the 
clean waiting and treatment area. 
 
a. Turn over the soil in an area that is 1 to 2 inches deep, and of sufficient length and width 
to accommodate a litter stand. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-293 
NOTE: The shuffle pit should be wide enough that the litter bearers are not able to straddle the 
pit or accommodating an ambulatory patient and two assistants. 
 
b. Mix super tropical bleach (STB) with the soil in a ratio of two parts STB to three parts 
earth (by volume). 
 5. Set up the protective shelter on the upwind side of the clean waiting and treatment area. 
 
a. Set up the protective shelter with the air lock adjoining the clean side of the 
decontamination station. 
 
b. When a protective shelter is not available for use, set up a protected medical treatment 
facility 30 to 50 meters upwind from the shuffle pit. 
 6. Set up the evacuation holding area. 
 
a. Set up an overhead cover of plastic sheeting at least 20 x 25 feet. 
 
b. Make sure the cover overlaps part of the clean treatment area and part of the protective 
shelter. 
 
c. When the protective shelter is used, set up the cover on the side opposite the generator. 
 7. Mark the hot line. The hot line separates the PDS warm zone (dirty side) from the cold zone 
(clean side) where the MTF is located. 
 
a. Use wire, engineer's tape, or other similar material to mark the entire perimeter of the hot 
line. 
 
b. Ensure that the hot line is clearly marked. 
 8. Establish ambulance points on both the "clean" and "dirty" evacuation routes. 
 
a. Establish a "dirty" ambulance point downwind from the triage area in the 
decontamination station. 
 
b. Establish a "clean" ambulance point upwind from the evacuation holding area on the 
clean side of the decontamination station. 
 9. Set up a contaminated dump. 
 
a. Establish the contaminated waste dump at least 75 to 100 meters downwind from the hot 
line. 
 
b. Bags of contaminated clothing and bandages are taken to this area where they are 
buried and marked with the appropriate hazard markers (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
"gas" markings). 
NOTE: The position is communicated to headquarters so that the waste can be disposed of 
properly. 
 10. Place chemical agent alarms upwind from the clean treatment area. 
 11. Camouflage areas IAW tactical directives. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use other Soldiers as your labor source. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier a decontamination station needs to be established.

Performance Steps 
 1. Follow principles of loading casualties aboard a rotary-wing aircraft. 
NOTE: The UH-60A Blackhawk, as with the UH-1H/V, has a number of possible seating or 
cargo configurations. A major difference in preparing the UH-60A to carry litters is that a medical 
evacuation kit must be installed. This kit consists of a seat/converter assembly unit and a litter 
support unit. The seat/converter assembly unit provides for three rear-facing seats which allow 
the medical attendant and crew chief to monitor casualties. The litter support unit consists of a 
center pedestal which can be rotated 90 degrees about the vertical axis for the loading and 
unloading of casualties. 
 
a. Responsibility for loading and securing a rotary-wing aircraft. 
 
(1) The pilot has the overall responsibility for the proper loading and securing of litter and 
ambulatory casualties and related equipment on board the aircraft. 
 
(2) The flight medic crewmember is responsible for ensuring that the litter squad follows 
the prescribed methods for loading litter or ambulatory casualties and securing litters and 
related medical equipment. 
 
(3) The final decision regarding how many casualties may be safely loaded rests with the 
pilot. 
 
b. Safety measures. 
 
(1) Litter bearers must present as low a silhouette as possible and must keep clear of 
the main and tail rotors at all times. 
 
(2) The helicopter must not be approached until a crewmember signals to do so. 
 
(3) The litter bearers should approach the aircraft at a 45-degree angle from the front of 
the helicopter. 
 
(4) If the helicopter is on a slope and conditions permit, loading personnel should 
approach the aircraft from the downhill side. 
 
(5) Directions given by the crew must be followed, and litters must be carried parallel to 
the ground. 
 
(6) Smoking is not permitted within 50 feet of the aircraft. 
 2. Determine UH-60 rotary wing aircraft load capacities. 
 
a. Four to six casualty litter capability of the support unit. 
 
b. If litter casualties are not being evacuated, a maximum of six ambulatory casualties can 
be seated on the litter support unit (three on each side). A seventh casualty can be seated on a 
troop seat. 
 3. Determine the loading sequence.

3 May 2013 
 
a. The most seriously injured casualties are loaded last on the bottom pans of the litter 
support unit. However, if it is anticipated that a casualty's medical condition may require in-flight 
emergency medical care (such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation), should be loaded onto either 
of the top pans to facilitate access. 
 
b. Casualties in traction splits should be loaded last and on a bottom pan. 
 
c. The UH-60A has the capability to be loaded on both sides simultaneously. Casualties 
should be loaded so that upon rotating the litter support, the casualty's head will be forward in 
the cabin. To accomplish this, casualties loaded on the left side of the aircraft should be loaded 
head first and casualties loaded on the right side of the aircraft should be loaded feet first (left 
and right sides are determined from the position of the pilot in command's seat, looking 
forward). 
 
d. When the six-litter configuration is used, the fifth and sixth litter casualties are loaded 
with the carousel in the fly position. The head of each casualty should face toward the front of 
the aircraft. 
 4. Direct nonmedical Soldiers to load and secure casualties. 
 
a. In loading four litter casualties with a four-man litter squad, the litters are loaded from the 
top to bottom. The sequence for loading litters from one side of the aircraft with the carousel 
turned is upper right, upper left, lower right, and then lower left. To load litters from both sides of 
the aircraft simultaneously, the sequence is upper then lower. 
 
(1) The litter support unit is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to receive the litter casualties. 
The flight crew lowers the top pan to accept the litter and stands by to assist. This is 
accomplished as the litter squad approaches the aircraft. 
 
(2) The litter squad moves into the semi overhead carry, lifting the litter just high enough 
for the litter stirrups of one end to slide onto the litter pan. The litter squad slides the litter 
forward. The flight crew member guides and assists the litter squad, until the litter stirrups of 
both ends are secured on the pan. The litter squad departs as the flight crew member raises the 
pan back to its upright position and secures it. The flight crew member fastens the litter straps 
attached to the litter support assembly. 
 
(3) After the first litter is loaded, the squad leaves the aircraft as a team to obtain another 
litter casualty. The second, third, and fourth litters are loaded in the same manner, except that 
the bottom pans are not tilted to receive casualties. 
 
(4) After having loaded four litter casualties, the litter support unit is rotated 90 degrees 
counterclockwise and locked in the in-flight position. The cargo doors must be closed for flight. 
 
b. The loading of six litter casualties requires the repositioning of the litter support prior to 
loading. The loading procedure remains the same as the four-litter configuration except for the 
following: 
 
(1) The top litter support no longer tilts. This necessitates overhead loading and may 
require additional assistance. 
 
(2) After four litters are loaded, the pedestal must be rotated back to the locked position. 
The restraint and tube assembly modification kit is then installed. The last two litters are side 
loaded between the restraints, with the casualtys' heads toward the front of the aircraft. They 
are secured. 
 
c. When the aircraft is to receive a mixed load of litter and ambulatory casualties, one top 
pan of the litter support is removed and repositioned just above the bottom pan on the same 
side. The aircraft can now accommodate two or three litter and four ambulatory casualties. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-299 
 
(1) The litter support unit is rotated clockwise to receive the litter casualties, except for 
the third litter in the six-litter configuration. Upon loading and securing the litter casualties, the 
litter support unit is rotated counterclockwise to the in-flight position. The third litter is then 
loaded when the six-litter configuration is used. 
 
(2) Ambulatory casualties are escorted to the aircraft by ground personnel. They are 
assisted into their seats and secured with the seat belts attached to the litter support unit. 
WARNING: To prevent further injury to casualties, all end support pins of the installed litter pans 
must be in the locked position for flight. 
 
(3) The cargo doors are now closed for flight. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use other Soldiers as litter bearers and casualties. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier that the simulated Soldiers require loading onto the helicopter. The 
graded Soldier will be the primary litter bearer and decide loading priorities.

Perform Manual Evacuation 
081-833-0282 
Conditions: You are in a care under fire situation. You have a team member that has been 
wounded by sniper fire. The casualty is unable to return fire, move to cover nor provide self aid. 
You and the rest of your team are behind cover and returning fire. Enemy fire has been 
suppressed and you must rapidly move to your casualty and manually evacuate him from the 
point of injury (POI) to cover. You will need a Combat Rescue Sling (CRS), Dragon Handle 
System, Dragon Harness and a Rescue Assault Tether (RAT) Strap System. If none of these 
are present, you will utilize one of the manual carries listed below. You are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Perform manual evacuation of your casualty, by extracting your casualty to cover 
with the use of the Combat Rescue Sling, Dragon Handle System, Dragon Harness System, 
RAT Strap System or manual carries without causing further injury. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Determine the appropriate extraction device, or carry for the tactical situation. 
 2. Communicate the plan to the casualty. 
 3. Tactically approach the casualty. 
 4. Secure the casualty's weapon and other equipment as feasible. 
 5. Properly attach the appropriate extraction device or secure the casualty for manual carry. 
 
a. Combat Rescue Sling (single rescuer). 
NOTE: The Combat Rescue Sling (CRS) is a five link, tubular nylon, extraction device that 
enables rescuers to either drag or carry a casualty. The CRS has five color coded tubular nylon 
loops (one green, two brown and two black) and is rated at 4,500 lbs. 
 
(1) Spread the CRS over the casualty’s body with the green loop on the casualty’s neck 
and the two brown loops at the casualty’s arms. 
 
(2) Place each arm through each of the two brown loops (one arm per loop). 
CAUTION: Do not place the casualty’s head through the green loop. 
 
(3) Take the entire green loop, which is on the casualty’s neck, and rotate it behind the 
casualty’s head. 
 
(4) Position yourself at the casualty’s head and grab both black loops, as handles. 
 
(5) Drag the casualty to cover. 
 
b. CRS (four man rescue). 
 
(1) Spread the CRS over the casualty’s body with the green loop on the casualty’s neck 
and the two brown loops at the casualty’s arms. 
 
(2) Slide one of the casualty’s legs through one of the black loops and the other leg 
through the other black loop. 
 
(3) Place each arm through each of the two brown loops (one arm per loop). 
CAUTION: Do not place the casualty’s head through the green loop. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-301 
 
(4) Take the entire green loop, that is on the casualty’s neck and rotate it behind the 
casualty’s head. 
 
(5) Have all four rescuers position themselves two on each side of the casualty, facing 
the same direction. 
 
(6) The rescuers at the casualty’s shoulders grab the brown loops and the rescuers at 
the casualty’s thighs grab the black loops. 
 
(7) All four rescuers lift the casualty off of the ground simultaneously and move out to 
cover. 
 
c. Dragon Handle System (head first extraction). 
NOTE: The Dragon Handle System is a rapid extraction device that has two handles, a metal 
floating bull ring (which provides for adjustable attachment points) and a spring actuated nonlocking carabiner. The Dragon Handle System has a tensile strength of 4,200 lbs and is made of 
1 inch tech tape. 
 
(1) Kneel down next to the closest shoulder of the casualty. 
WARNING: Do not pass the carabiner under the strap that attaches the DAP (Deltoid Armor 
Protection) to the shoulder strap of the body armor. 
 
(2) Pass the carabiner (that is attached to the distal portion of the Dragon Handle 
System) under the shoulder strap of the casualty’s body armor. 
 
(3) Pass the Dragon Handle straps through the keeper of the carabiner and pull up 
(taking out the slack). 
NOTE: If the rescuer is short, hook the carabiner through the two loops located approximately 
1/3 down from the handles. 
 
(4) Grab both Dragon Handles with the non firing hand and stand up. 
 
(5) Stand up and lean slightly back (which will slightly elevate the casualty’s torso off the 
ground). 
 
(6) Drag the casualty to cover. 
 
d. Dragon Handle System (feet first extraction). 
 
(1) Kneel down next to the casualty’s feet. 
 
(2) Pass the carabiner (that is attached to the distal portion of the Dragon Handles) 
under and around the casualty’s ankles. 
 
(3) Pass the Dragon Handle straps through the keeper of the carabiner and pull up 
(taking out the slack). 
 
(4) Grab both Dragon Handles with the non firing hand and stand up. 
 
(5) Stand up and lean slightly back (which will slightly elevate the casualty’s legs off the 
ground). 
NOTE: This will lift both of the casualty’s legs and reduce the friction that the casualty’s body 
would create. 
 
(6) Drag the casualty to cover. 
 
e. Dragon Harness System. 
NOTE: The Dragon Harness System is a lightweight, built-in-handle harness system that is 
constructed of two inch nylon webbing and is rated at over 3,000lbs tensile strength. The 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-302 
 
3 May 2013 
harness is worn like a vest under the body armor of the casualty. The drag handles are stowed 
slightly above the rear collar of the body armor and are held in place by a Velcro strap. The 
benefit of the Dragon Harness is that when the casualty is being extracted, the casualty’s body 
armor doesn’t move up toward the casualty’s head exposing more of the casualty’s torso to 
possible enemy fire. 
 
(1) Kneel down next to the casualty’s shoulders. 
 
(2) Grab both Dragon Handles with the non firing hand and stand up. 
 
(3) Stand up and lean slightly back (which will slightly elevate the casualty’s torso off the 
ground). 
 
(4) Drag the casualty to cover. 
 
f. RAT Strap (feet first rescue). 
NOTE: The RAT Strap is a 1 inch tech tape patient extraction system that has a quick release 
shackle on one end and a National Fire Protection Association NFPA rated carabiner on the 
opposite end. The RAT Strap is rated at 4,200lbs tensile strength. Along over two thirds of the 
length of the strap (from the quick release shackle to approximately two thirds of the strap) there 
is reinforced stitching, triple bar tacked loops which enables the rescuer to shorten the length of 
the strap to elevate the casualty’s body off the ground and reduce friction during the extraction. 
In order to use the RAT Strap, a special belt with a carabiner attachment ring must be worn or a 
regular military belt must be fitted with a carabiner. The RAT Strap should be attached to the 
carabiner attachment ring, or the carabiner (attached already to the rescuer’s belt) by way of the 
Quick Release Shackle, and tucked into the rescuer’s trouser pocket that is located on the 
rescuer’s non firing hand side, prior to tactically approaching the casualty. 
Estimate the amount of slack that would be needed to be taken out of the overall length of the 
RAT Strap to ensure that the casualty’s upper torso will lift off of the ground. Hook the carabiner 
through the triple bar tack loop that will give you the proper length of the RAT Strap. 
 
(1) Kneel down next to the casualty’s feet. 
 
(2) Pass the carabiner (that is attached to the distal portion of the RAT Strap) under and 
around the casualty’s ankles. 
 
(3) Loop the RAT Strap through the keeper of the carabiner and pull up (taking out the 
slack). 
 
(4) Stand up and lean slightly back (which will slightly elevate the casualty’s legs off the 
ground). 
 
(5) Drag the casualty to cover. 
 
g. RAT Strap (head first rescue). 
WARNING: Do not pass the carabiner under the strap that attaches the DAP to the shoulder 
strap of the body armor. 
 
(1) Pass the carabiner (that is attached to the distal portion of the RAT Strap) under the 
shoulder strap of the casualty’s body armor. 
 
(2) Pass the RAT Strap through the keeper of the carabiner and pull up (taking out the 
slack). 
 
(3) Stand up and lean slightly back (which will slightly elevate the casualty’s legs off the 
ground).

(4) Drag the casualty to cover. 
 
h. Hawes Carry. 
NOTE: The Hawes Carry can only be performed on a conscious casualty that can hold onto the 
rescuers body. 
 
(1) Assist the casualty in standing. 
 
(2) Squat in front of the casualty, while maintaining an erect posture. 
 
(3) Have the casualty lean forward, against the rescuer’s back, and wrap an arm around 
the rescuer’s neck and across the rescuers chest. 
NOTE: The casualty wraps the same arm as the rescuer’s shooting hand around the rescuer’s 
neck. This enables the rescuer to secure the casualty’s arm with his non-firing hand. 
 
(4) The rescuer then leans slightly forward and then stands up (lifting with the large 
muscles of the legs). 
 
(5) The rescuer then moves out to cover with the casualty. 
 
i. SEAL Team Three Carry. 
 
(1) Have a rescuer kneel on both sides of the casualty. 
 
(2) Place the casualty in the sitting position. 
 
(3) Place the casualty’s arms around each of the two rescuer’s neck. 
 
(4) Have the rescuers grab the casualty’s wrist with the hands located on the outside of 
the rescuers’ body. 
 
(5) Have the rescuers grab the casualty’s belt with the hands located on the inside 
towards the casualty. 
 
(6) Both rescuers simultaneously stand (lifting with the large muscles of the legs). 
 
(7) The rescuers then move out to cover with the casualty. 
 6. Extract the casualty to cover. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: At the test site, provide all equipment, information, and personnel given in the task

Establish a Casualty Collection Point 
081-833-0152 
Conditions: You have a tactical battle plan for medical evacuation. You will need FM 4-02. 4 
and FM 4-02. 6. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Establish a casualty collection point (CCP). 
Performance Steps 
 1. Select the site. 
NOTE: Tactical battle plans will vary depending on the type and number of units incorporated 
into the plan. The plan for casualty collection points (CCP) will vary also. The medical treatment 
provided on the battlefield is usually accomplished by the unit's combat medics and combat 
lifesavers. Establishment of a CCP is essential for the rapid treatment and evacuation of the 
casualty. 
 
a. The location of the CCP will depend on the unit location, the tactical situation, and the 
number of casualties to be evacuated. 
 
b. This location should be decided by the unit first sergeant with guidance from the 
company/platoon medics. 
 
c. Battle drills and tactical standard operating procedures (TSOPs) should be established 
on how they will get the casualty from the fighting position or vehicle to the CCP. 
 
d. The platoon CCP should be located at the platoon's rear. 
 
e. The company CCP should be located in a covered and concealed position with the 
company trains. 
 2. Establish the CCP with day and night marking systems. 
 3. Establish a separate triage area with day and night marking systems. 
 4. Establish a choke point for entry and exit of the CCP to track casualties and control access. 
NOTE: The choke point is also where casualties are triaged. 
 5. Establish and properly mark evacuation categories for day and night (non-tactical or 
tactical) operations. 
NOTE: When marking the evacuation category areas for day and night operations, one should 
utilize the marking procedures outlined in the unit’s TSOP. An example of marking evacuation 
category areas for day time operations is utilizing red for Immediate /(Urgent/Urgent Surgical), 
green for Delayed /Priority, blue for Expectant /Routine and None for Minimal /Convenience. For 
night non-tactical CCP operations, the same color code used during daytime CCP operations 
can be used with colored chemlights. For night tactical CCP operations, an example of marking 
would be 1 Infrared ( IR) chemlight for Immediate /(Urgent/Urgent Surgical), 2 IR chemlights for 
Delayed / Priority, 3 IR chemlights for Expectant /Routine and 4 chemlights for Minimal 
/Convenience. 
 6. Establish a killed in action (KIA) area away from the other casualties. 
 7. Establish a medical resupply area. 
 8. Establish a helicopter landing zone. 
NOTE: A helicopter landing zone should be properly marked for air evacuation. 
 9. Plan movement of casualties. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-306 
 
3 May 2013 
 
a. Casualty movement from point of wounding to the platoon CCP will be by field expedient 
means: individual manual carries, litter (SKED, talon, pole less) carries, or casualty evacuation 
vehicle. 
 
b. Nonstandard casualty evacuation vehicles are positioned forward with a M113A3, 
Stryker, M996, or M997 track or wheeled ambulance designated for litter casualties at the 
company CCP. 
 
c. The first sergeant coordinates casualty flow between the platoon CCPs and the company 
CCP while the senior medic conducts triage. 
 
d. Communication of 9 line medical evacuation requests is conducted via the platoon or 
company elements to the battalion aid station (BAS.) 
 
e. The procedure/drill from the CCP to the BAS focuses largely on distance, routes, 
security, and operational procedures at the BAS. 
NOTE: "Operational procedures" refers to the set up and functionality of the BAS with regards to 
casualty flow, triage, treatment, and various other functions required for successful operation. In 
some cases the BAS will split into two treatment teams: the main aid station (MAS) and a 
forward aid station (FAS). Often the MAS and the FAS will conduct bounding movement during 
an offensive operation to maintain doctrinal distance during the fight. Whether evacuation is 
from the CCP to the MAS, FAS, or BAS the system remains essentially the same. 
NOTE: Doctrinal distance is considered to be 1 to 4 kilometers and/or one to two terrain 
features behind the unit supported, emphasizing mission, enemy, terrain, troops, time available, 
and civilian considerations (METT-TC). Failure to maintain this is a common error. Usually the 
distance becomes extended due to poor planning, failure to commit medical assets forward, 
lack of clearly defined triggers, or communications failures. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: At the test site, provide all equipment, information, and personnel given in the task 
conditions statement. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier that he must establish a casualty collection point (CCP) and may 
have to request medical evacuation and establish a helicopter landing point after establishing 
the CCP.

WARNING: Moving or sliding interior components can pinch or crush fingers or hands. Ensure 
fingers or hands are clear of pinch points before adjusting equipment. Use provided handles to 
prevent injury. Failure to comply may result in injury to personnel. 
Conditions: You have completed treating and triaging multiple casualties. You are in charge of 
loading litter and ambulatory casualties onto a Mine Resitant Heavily Armored Ground 
Ambulance (HAGA). You will need a HAGA armored ambulance and litters. You are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Load casualties in the correct sequence for the evacuation platform without causing 
further harm to the casualties. 
NOTE:The litter system stowed configuration is used for the transport of medical supplies and 
the medical decontamination of the ambulance. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Configure stairs to ramp. 
WARNING: Ensure hands and feet are clear of the ramp. The upper section of the ramp will 
drop when the ramp is unfolded resulting in crushed or pinched body parts. Failure to comply 
may result in injury to personnel. 
 
a. Ensure that the ramp door is closed. 
 
b. While supporting the ramp assembly, lift and release the secure clamps from the latches, 
allowing the ramp to be unfolded. 
 
c. Unfold and straighten the lower ramp section from the middle ramp section. 
 
d. Lift the middle and lower ramp section until they are parallel to the ground. 
 
e. Disengage the retaining pin from the lower ramp section. 
 
f. Rotate the ramp steps where the steps face the ground. 
 
g. Re-engage the retaining pin in the lower ramp step until the step locks into position. 
 
h. Lower the ramp until the bottom reversed step contacts the ground. 
 
i. Lift the ramp and straighten the combined middle and lower section to the upper ramp 
section. 
 
j. Make sure the locks are completely engaged with the pins on the middle ramp section. 
 
k. Lower the entire ramp to make contact with the ground. 
 
l. Open the rear door and lock into place. 
 2. Configure the left side of the casualty compartment for litter casualties. 
 
a. The first step in transitioning the litter system from the stowed configuration to any other 
patient load configuration is to rotate the left footrest into its functional position. 
 
(1) Twist to unlock and pull to disengage the front and rear capture pins, on the left litter 
system seat, and rotate the foot rest out.

(2) Push in and twist the two capture pins, on the left litter system seat, locking the 
footrest in the functional position. 
WARNING: Failure of seated personnel to use designated footrests may result in injury. 
Maintain positive physical control of vertical and horizontal portions of the litter system at all 
times while the capture pins are in the unlocked and out position. 
 
b. Twist to unlock and pull to disengage the front and rear capture pins for the left litter 
system seat and rotate the left seat bottom to the down position. 
 
c. Push to engage and twist to lock the forward and rear capture pins to lock the left seat 
back in the vertical position. 
 
d. Remove and store the left seat back cushion. 
 
e. Twist to unlock and pull to disengage the front and rear capture pins to unlock the left 
seat back, and rotate the left seat back into the lower left litter position. 
 
f. Push to engage and twist to lock the forward and rear capture pins of the left lower litter 
system. 
CAUTION: The litter system attached to the litter lift should be in the unstowed (horizontal) 
position prior to raising the lift. Failure to unstow the litter system could result in system damage.
 
g. Twist to unlock and pull to disengage the forward and rear capture pins of the upper left 
litter systems. 
 
h. Rotate the upper left litter system to the horizontal position. 
 
i. Push in to engage and twist to lock the forward and rear capture pins of the upper left 
litter system. 
 
j. Slide out the upper left litter system. 
 
(1) Pull the center pull handle to retract the slide lock pins. This will release the litter 
system slide and allow it to move. 
 
(2) Pull the litter system slide out (towards the center of the patient compartment) until it 
stops. 
 
(3) Release the center pull handle to engage the slide lock pins and lock the litter slide in 
place. 
 3. Load the litter casualties on the left upper and left lower litter systems. 
CAUTION: The stairs should be reconfigured to the ramp configuration to ensure safe loading 
of casualties into the evacuation platform. 
 
a. Load the casualty into the evacuation platform head first. 
 
(1) Lift the litter with one person holding both litter handles at the casualty’s head and 
one person at the casualty’s feet. Place two litter bearers along the side of the litter to support 
the litter while the litter bearers walk up the litter ramp. 
 
(2) Once the litter bearer at the casualty’s head comes into close proximity to the

Unload Casualties From a UH-60 Series Helicopter 
081-833-0294 
Conditions: A UH-60 series helicopter has arrived at your medical treatment facility (MTF) and 
you are in charge of unloading the litter and ambulatory patients. You will need a UH-60 series 
helicopter with a medical evacuation kit installed, four litters, eight litter straps and four 
nonmedical Soldiers to act as litter bearers. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Unload the UH-60 series helicopter in the correct sequence without causing further 
injury. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Follow the principles of unloading casualties from a rotary-wing aircraft. 
 
a. Responsibility for unloading a rotary-wing aircraft. 
 
(1) The pilot in command has the overall responsibility for the proper unloading of the 
aircraft, as well as, all safety considerations inside and around the aircraft. 
 
(2) The flight medic is responsible for ensuring that the litter squad follows the prescribed 
methods for unloading litter and ambulatory casualties and securing litters and related medical 
equipment. 
 
(3) The flight medic also determines which casualties are unloaded first. 
 
b. Safety measures. 
 
(1) Litter bearers must present as low a silhouette as possible and must keep clear of 
the main and tail rotors at all times. 
 
(2) The helicopter must not be approached until a crewmember signals to do so. 
 
(3) The litter bearers should approach the aircraft at a 90 degree angle from the side of 
the helicopter ensuring that no litter bearers pass behind the cargo doors of the aircraft. 
 
(4) If the helicopter is on a slope and conditions permit, unloading personnel should 
approach the aircraft from the downhill side. 
 
(5) Directions given by the crew must be followed, and litters must be carried parallel to 
the ground. 
 
(6) All patient equipment such as blankets should be secured to the litter to prevent any 
potential damage to the aircraft. 
 
(7) Smoking is not permitted within 50 feet of the aircraft. 
 2. Unload casualties from the rotary-wing aircraft.

WARNING: When moving a casualty onto a litter, the casualty must be wearing an Army 
Combat Helmet (ACH) unless the casualty’s wounds prevent the use of an ACH. 
 2. Load a casualty onto a litter. 
 
a. Have three litter bearers kneel at the casualty’s side. 
NOTE: Have a litter bearer face the casualty and kneel at the casualty's shoulders, hips and 
ankles at the same side of the casualty. 
 
b. Have the litter bearers place their arms under the casualty’s shoulders, back, hips and 
lower legs carefully supporting the casualty’s neck and body. 
 
c. All bearers lift the casualty to their chests while supporting the casualty on one knee. 
 
d. Have the fourth litter bearer place the litter below the casualty on the ground. 
 
e. The fourth litter bearer supports the opposite side of the casualty while the casualty is 
lowered slowly to the litter. 
 
f. Slowly lower the casualty onto the litter. 
 
g. Secure the casualty to the litter by applying a patient securing strap around the chest of 
the casualty and the litter, as well as a patient securing strap around the knees of the casualty 
and the litter. 
 3. Transport a casualty using a litter. 
 
a. Four man carry. 
 
(1) Have a litter bearer stand at each handle of the litter(four litter bearers total). 
 
(2) Each position is numbered from 1 to 4. 
 
 
(a) The position at the right side of the casualty’s head is the number 1 position and is 
the Squad Leader. All commands come from the number 1 litter bearer. 
 
 
(b) The position at the casualty’s right foot is the number 2 litter bearer. 
 
 
(c) The position at the left side of the casualty’s head is the number 3 litter bearer.

(d) The position at the casualty’s left foot is the number 4 litter bearer. 
 
(3) Have all four litter bearers face toward the casualty’s feet, kneel and grab the litter 
handles. 
 
(4) The number 1 position gives the preparatory command “Prepare to Lift” and the 
command of execution “Lift”. 
 
(5) Upon the command of execution “lift”, all four litter bearers will stand simultaneously. 
 
(6) The direction of travel for the patient is feet first on level terrain. 
 
(7) Once the litter is lifted off of the ground and all four litter bearers are standing, the 
command to proceed is “Four Man Carry, Move. 
 
b. Two-man carry. 
NOTE: The two man carry is given when passing through or over narrow passages such as 
trails, bridges, gangplanks, culverts and catwalks. 
 
(1) The preparatory command is “Two Man Carry” and the command of execution is 
“Move.” 
 
(2) Upon the preparatory command “Two Man Carry”, the number 3 litter bearer adjusts 
his hold and grabs both litter handles at the casualty’s head.

Triage Casualties 
081-833-0281 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: You have several casualties requiring triage. You will need a pen and a DD Form 
1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You have taken body substance isolation (BSI) 
precautions. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Complete all the steps necessary to establish priorities for treatment and the 
evacuation of casualties. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Assess the situation. 
 
a. Sort the casualties and allocate treatment based on the resources available. 
 
(1) Assess and classify the casualties for the most efficient use of available medical 
personnel and supplies. 
 
(2) Give available treatment first to the casualties who have the best chance of survival. 
 
(3) A primary goal is to locate, and return to duty, troops with minor wounds; however, at 
no time should abandonment of a single casualty be considered. 
 
(4) Triage establishes the order of treatment, not whether treatment is given. It is usually 
the responsibility of the senior medical person present. 
 
b. Determine the tactical and environmental situation. 
 
(1) Whether casualties must be transported to a more secure area for treatment. 
 
(2) The number and location of the injured and the severity of the injuries. 
 
(3) Available assistance (self-aid, buddy-aid, combat lifesaver, and medical personnel). 
 
(4) Evacuation support capabilities and requirements. 
 2. Assess the casualties and establish priorities for treatment. 
 
a. Immediate-casualties whose conditions demand immediate treatment to save life, limb or 
eyesight. This category has the highest priority. 
 
(1) Airway obstruction. 
 
(2) Respiratory and cardiorespiratory distress from otherwise treatable injuries (for 
example, electrical shock, drowning or chemical exposure). 
NOTE: A casualty with cardiorespiratory distress may not be classified "Immediate" on the 
battlefield. This casualty may be classified "Expectant", contingent upon such things as the 
situation, number of casualties, and available support. 
 
(3) Massive external bleeding. 
 
(4) Shock. 
 
(5) Burns on the face, neck, hands, feet, perineum or genitalia. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-327 
NOTE: After all life- or limb-threatening conditions have been successfully treated; give no 
further treatment to the casualty until all other "Immediate" casualties have been treated. 
Salvage of life always takes priority over salvage of limb. 
 
b. Delayed-casualties who have less risk of loss of life or limb if treatment is delayed. 
 
(1) Open wounds of the chest without respiratory distress. 
 
(2) Open or penetrating abdominal injuries without shock. 
 
(3) Severe eye injuries without hope of saving eyesight. 
 
(4) Other open wounds. 
 
(5) Fractures. 
 
(6) Second and third degree burns (not involving the face, hands, feet, genitalia, and 
perineum) covering 20% or more of the total body surface area (TBSA). 
 
c. Minimal-"walking wounded", can be treated by self-aid or buddy-aid. 
 
(1) Minor lacerations and contusions. 
 
(2) Sprains and strains. 
 
(3) Minor combat stress problems. 
 
(4) First or second degree burns (not involving the face, hands, feet, genitalia, and 
perineum) covering under 20% of the TBSA. 
NOTE: Minimal casualties may assist the Soldier Medic by providing buddy-aid or by monitoring 
other casualties. 
 
d. Expectant-casualties who are so critically injured that only complicated and prolonged 
treatment can improve life expectancy. This category is to be used only if resources are limited. 
If in doubt as to the severity of the injury, place the casualty in one of the other categories. 
 
(1) Massive head injuries with signs of impending death. 
 
(2) Burns, mostly third degree, covering more than 85% of the TBSA. 
NOTE: Provide ongoing supportive care if the time and condition permit; keep separate from 
other triage categorized casualties. (See common core task 101-515-0002.) 
 3. Record all treatment given on the FMC. (See task 081-831-0033.) 
 4. Establish MEDEVAC priorities by precedence category. 
 
a. Urgent. Evacuation is required as soon as possible, but within 1 hour, to save life, limb or 
eyesight. Generally, casualties whose conditions cannot be controlled and have the greatest 
opportunity for survival are placed in this category. 
 
(1) Cardiorespiratory distress. 
 
(2) Shock not responding to IV fluid therapy. 
 
(3) Prolonged unconsciousness. 
 
(4) Head injuries with signs of increasing intracranial pressure. 
 
(5) Burns covering 20% to 85% of the TBSA. 
 
b. Urgent Surgical. Evacuation is required for casualties who must receive far forward 
surgical intervention to save life and stabilize for further evacuation. 
 
(1) Decreased circulation in the extremities. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-328 
 
3 May 2013 
 
(2) Open chest and/or abdominal wounds with decreased blood pressure. 
 
(3) Penetrating wounds. 
 
(4) Uncontrollable hemorrhage or open fractures with severe hemorrhage. 
 
(5) Severe facial injuries. 
 
c. Priority. Evacuation is required within 4 hours or the casualty's condition could get worse 
and become an "Urgent" or "Urgent Surgical" category condition. Generally, this category 
applies to any casualty whose condition is not stabilized or who is at risk of trauma-related 
complications. 
 
(1) Closed-chest injuries, such as rib fractures without a flail segment or other injuries 
that interfere with respiration. 
 
(2) Brief periods of unconsciousness. 
 
(3) Soft tissue injuries and open or closed fractures. 
 
(4) Abdominal injuries without hypotension. 
 
(5) Eye injuries that do not threaten eyesight. 
 
(6) Spinal injuries. 
 
(7) Burns on the hands, face, feet, genitalia, or perineum, even if under 20% of the 
TBSA. 
 
d. Routine. Evacuation is required within 24 hours for further care. Immediate evacuation is 
not critical. Generally, casualties who can be controlled without jeopardizing their condition or 
who can be managed by the evacuating facility for up to 24 hours. 
 
(1) Burns covering 20% - 80% of the TBSA if the casualty is receiving and responding to 
IV fluid therapy. 
 
(2) Simple fractures. 
 
(3) Open wounds including chest injuries without respiratory distress. 
 
(4) Behavioral emergencies and combat stress casualties. 
 
(5) Terminal cases. 
 
e. Convenience. Evacuation by medical vehicle is a matter of convenience rather than 
necessity. 
 
(1) Minor open wounds. 
 
(2) Sprains and strains. 
 
(3) Minor burns under 20% of TBSA. 
 5. Prepare a medical evacuation request. (See STP 21-24-SMCT, task 081-831-0101.) 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation construct a scenario that involves multiple combat casualties. 
Moulaged Soldiers may be used as casualties. Brief each Soldier as to their wounds and what 
their actions should be when assessed. Tell the casualties not to assist the Soldier in any way; 
unless they are designated as “minimal” casualties and instructed to provide buddy-aid. 
Brief the Soldier: Tell the Soldier to assess the situation and the casualties, establish priority of 
treatment, establish MEDEVAC priorities, and prepare the evacuation request.

Subject Area 10: Medication Administration 
Prepare an Injection for Administration 
081-833-0088 
Conditions: You must prepare an injection for administration. You will need needles and 
syringes, medication, alcohol sponges, dry sterile gauze, and a medical officer's order. You 
have performed a patient care handwash. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Select, inspect, and assemble the appropriate needle and syringe. Draw the correct 
medication. Follow aseptic technique throughout the procedure. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Select an appropriate needle. 
 
a. Select a needle with the proper length based upon the following factors: 
 
(1) The type of injection to be given (subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal). 
 
(2) The size of the patient (thin, obese). 
 
(3) The injection site (1 inch for deltoid, 1 1/2 inches for gluteus maximus). 
 
b. Select a needle with the proper gauge based upon the thickness of the medication to be 
injected. 
NOTE: The gauge of the needle is indicated by the numbers 10 through 27. The higher the 
number, the smaller the diameter (bore) of the needle. A small bore needle is indicated for thin 
medications. A large bore needle is indicated for thick medications. 
 2. Select an appropriate syringe. 
 
a. Check the drug manufacturer's specifications to determine whether a glass or plastic 
syringe should be used for the medication. 
NOTE: Some medications deteriorate in a plastic syringe. Drug manufacturer's specifications 
provide guidance. 
 
b. Ensure that the total capacity of the syringe, usually measured in cubic centimeters (cc), 
is appropriate for the amount of medication to be administered. 
 
c. Check the intervals of the calibration marks on the syringe. 
 3. Inspect the needle and syringe packaging for defects such as open packages, holes, and 
water spotting. 
NOTE: Discard the equipment if any defect is found. 
 4. Unpack the syringe. 
 
a. If the syringe is in a flexible wrapper, peel the sides of the wrapper apart to expose the 
rear end of the syringe barrel. 
CAUTION: The needle adapter and the shaft of the plunger are sterile. Contamination could 
cause infection in the patient. The outside of the syringe barrel does not have to be kept sterile. 
 
b. Grasp the syringe by the barrel with the free hand. 
 
c. Pull the syringe from the packaging. 
 
d. If the syringe is packaged in a hard plastic tube container, press down and twist the cap 
until a distinct "pop" is heard. If the "pop" is not heard, the seal has been previously broken and 
the equipment must be discarded. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-331 
 5. Inspect the syringe. 
 
a. Grasp the flared end of the syringe and pull the plunger back and forth to test for smooth, 
easy movement. 
 
b. Visually check the rubber stopper (inside the syringe) to ensure that it is attached 
securely to the top end of the plunger, forming a seal. 
 
c. If the plunger is stuck or does not move smoothly, discard the syringe. 
 
d. Push the plunger fully into the barrel until ready to fill the syringe with medication. 
CAUTION: All parts of the needle are sterile. Be careful not to touch the hub. This would 
contaminate the needle and possibly pass an infection to the patient. Only the outside of the 
needle cover may be touched. 
 6. Unpack the needle. 
 
a. If the needle is packaged in a flexible wrapper, peel the sides of the wrapper apart to 
expose the needle hub. 
 
b. If the needle is packaged in a hard plastic tube, twist the cap of the tube until a "pop" is 
heard. Remove the cap to expose the needle hub. If a "pop" is not heard, the seal has been 
previously broken, and the equipment must be discarded. 
 7. Join the needle and the syringe. 
 
a. Insert the needle adapter of the syringe into the hub of the needle. 
 
b. Tighten the needle by turning 1/4 of a turn to ensure that it is securely attached. 
 8. Inspect the needle. 
 
a. Hold the needle and syringe upright and remove the protective cover from the needle by 
pulling it straight off. 
NOTE: A twisting motion may pull the needle off the hub. 
 
b. Visually inspect the needle for burrs, barbs, damage, and contamination. If the needle 
has any defects or damage, replace it with another sterile needle. 
 
c. Place the protective cover back on the needle utilizing the "scoop" method. 
 9. Place the assembled needle and syringe on the work surface. 
 
a. Leave the protective cover on the needle. 
 
b. Leave the plunger pushed fully into the barrel. 
 
c. Keep the assembled needle and syringe continually within range of vision. 
NOTE: When you assemble a needle and syringe, you are responsible for maintaining sterility 
and security of the equipment. 
 10. Verify the drug label and check the container for defects. 
 
a. Compare the medication with the medical officer's orders. The medication label must be 
verified three times. 
 
(1) When obtained from the place of storage. 
 
(2) When withdrawing the medication. 
 
(3) When returning the container to storage. 
 
b. Examine the container.

(1) Examine the rubber stopper for defects, such as small cores or plugs torn from the 
stopper. 
 
(2) Hold the vial to the light to check for foreign particles and changes in color and 
consistency. If the solution is in a dark vial, withdraw some solution to perform the checks. 
 
(3) Check the date multidose vial was opened and check the expiration date of the 
medication. 
 
(4) Determine whether the medication was stored properly, such as under refrigeration. 
NOTE: If there is any evidence of contamination, discard the container and obtain another. 
 11. Prepare and draw the medication. 
 
a. Draw medication from a stoppered vial which contains a prepared solution. 
 
(1) Remove the protective cap. 
 
(2) Clean the stopper and neck of the vial with an alcohol sponge. 
 
(3) Pick up the assembled needle and syringe and remove the protective needle cover. 
 
(4) Slowly draw the plunger to the prescribed cc mark of medication. 
 
(5) Pick up the vial and insert the needle into the rubber stopper, exerting slight 
downward and forward pressure. Ensure that the needle tip passes completely through the cap. 
NOTE: To avoid contamination, the hub of the needle should not touch the rubber cap. 
 
(6) Push the plunger fully into the barrel to inject the air. 
 
(7) With the vial inverted (and keeping the needle tip in the solution), pull the plunger 
back to the desired cc mark, withdrawing the medication. 
 
(8) Withdraw the needle from the container. 
 
(9) Verify the correct dosage against the medical officer's orders by raising the syringe to 
eye level and ensuring that the forward edge of the plunger is exactly on the prescribed cc 
mark. 
 
b. Draw medication from a stoppered vial which contains a powdered medication which 
must be prepared. 
 
(1) Remove the protective caps from the vial containing the powdered medication and 
the vial containing the sterile diluent. 
 
(2) Clean the stoppers of both vials with alcohol sponges. 
 
(3) Withdraw the required diluent, using the same procedure as for a stoppered vial. 
(See steps 11a(3) through 11a(8).) 
 
(4) Hold the vial with the powdered medication horizontally, insert the needle through the 
stopper, and inject the diluent. 
NOTE: If the vial with powdered medication contains air, the diluent may be difficult to inject. Air 
may have to be withdrawn to allow the diluent to be injected. 
 
(5) Withdraw the needle. 
 
(6) Gently invert the vial several times until all the powder is dissolved. Visually inspect 
the solution to ensure that it is well-mixed.

Administer an Intramuscular Injection 
081-833-0301 
Conditions: You have a patient that requires an intramuscular injection. You will need 
syringe(s) with the prepared medication(s), antiseptic pads, alcohol sponge swabs, sterile 
gauze, adhesive tape, and the patient's record. You have performed a patient care handwash 
and have verified the medical officer's order. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Administer the injection in accordance (IAW) with the medical officer's order without 
violating aseptic technique or causing injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Verify the required injection(s) with the medical officer's order. 
WARNINGS: 1. If there is a known allergy, do not administer the injection. Consult the medical 
officer. 2. Determine if a female patient is pregnant because of possible side effects of certain 
immunizing agents on the unborn child. If there is a question, do not administer the injection 
without written authorization. 
 2. Identify the patient by asking the patient's name and checking the identification tag or band. 
 3. Ask the patient if he/she has any allergies or has experienced a drug reaction. 
WARNING: Have an emergency tray available for the immediate treatment of serious reactions. 
Include a constricting band and a syringe containing a 1:1000 solution of epinephrine. 
 4. Verify that the appropriate needle, syringe, and medication are being used. (See task 081833-0088.) 
 5. Select and expose the injection site. 
 
a. The upper arm deltoid muscle-the outer 1/3 of the arm between the lower edge of the 
shoulder bone and the armpit. Approximately three finger widths below the shoulder bone is the 
safe area. 
 
b. Buttocks-the upper-outer quadrant of either buttock. 
NOTE: To identify the injection site, draw an imaginary horizontal line across the buttocks from 
hip bone to hip bone. Then divide each buttock in half with an imaginary vertical line. (See 
Figure 3-7.) 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-336 
 
3 May 2013 
 
Figure 3-7. Buttock in half 
WARNING: Do not give the injection in an area outside the upper-outer quadrant. The needle 
may do irreparable damage to the sciatic nerve or pierce the gluteal artery and cause significant 
bleeding. 
 
c. Outer thigh-the area between a hand's width above the knee and a hand's width below 
the groin. 
 6. Position the patient. 
 
a. Upper arm-standing or sitting with the area completely exposed, muscles relaxed, and 
the arm at the side. 
 
b. Buttocks-lying face down or leaning forward and supported by a stable object with the 
weight shifted to the leg that will not be injected. The area is completely exposed. 
NOTE: If the patient is lying in a prone position (face down), place the toes together with the 
heels apart. This will relax the muscles of the buttocks. 
 
c. Outer thigh-lying face up or seated with the area completely exposed. 
 7. Clean the injection site. 
 
a. Open the antiseptic pad package. 
 
b. Begin at the injection site and move the pad outward in a circular motion to a 
circumference of about 2 inches (5cm). 
 
c. Allow the skin to dry completely before administering injection. 
NOTE: This will avoid a stinging sensation from introducing alcohol into subcutaneous tissue. 
 8. Pull the needle cover straight off without bending or touching the needle. 
WARNING: Do not violate aseptic technique. 
 9. Prepare the skin for the injection. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

about 1/2 inch from, the skin surface. 
 
b. Plunge the needle firmly and quickly, in one motion straight into the muscle. 
 11. Release the hold on the skin. 
 12. Administer the medication. 
 
a. Aspirate by pulling back slightly on the plunger of the syringe. 
WARNING: Do not aspirate for blood when giving insulin or heparin. It is not necessary with 
insulin and may cause a hematoma with heparin. 
 
(1) If blood appears, stop the procedure. Go to step 4 and begin the procedure again. 
Use a new needle, syringe, and medication, and select a different injection site. 
CAUTION: If blood appears in the syringe, the needle is in a blood vessel. If this occurs, stop 
the injection, withdraw the needle, prepare another injection with new equipment, and inject 
another site. 
 
(2) If no blood appears, continue the procedure. 
 
b. Using a slow continuous movement, completely depress the plunger, injecting the 
medication. 
NOTE: Rapid pressure may cause a burning pain. 
 
c. After injection, withdraw the needle at the same angle at which it was inserted. 
NOTE: Gently, but quickly. 
 
d. Discard syringe with needle attached in sharps container IAW local facilities' standing 
operating procedure (SOP). 
 
e. Place an antiseptic pad (or 2 x 2 gauze pad) over the injection site and gently massage 
the site (unless contraindicated, as with heparin and insulin), to distribute the medication and 
facilitate absorption. 
 
f. Remove the alcohol pad and check the injection site for bleeding and/or bruising. 
NOTE: Place bandage over site if small amount of bleeding is noted.

Administer a Subcutaneous Injection 
081-833-0302 
Conditions: You have a patient that requires a subcutaneous injection. You will need syringe(s) 
with the prepared medication(s), antiseptic pads, alcohol sponge swabs, sterile gauze, adhesive 
tape, and the patient's record. You have performed a patient care handwash and have verified 
the medical officer's order. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Administer the injection in accordance with (IAW) the medical officer's order without 
violating aseptic technique or causing injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Verify the required injection(s) with the medical officer's order. 
WARNINGS: 1. If there is a known allergy, do not administer the injection. Consult your 
supervisor. 2. Determine if a female patient is pregnant because of possible side effects of 
certain immunizing agents on the unborn child. If there is a question, do not administer the 
injection without written authorization. 
 2. Identify the patient by asking the patient's name and checking the identification tag or band. 
 3. Ask the patient if he/she has any allergies or has experienced a drug reaction. 
WARNING: Have an emergency tray available for the immediate treatment of serious reactions. 
Include a constricting band and a syringe containing a 1:1000 solution of epinephrine. 
 4. Verify that the appropriate needle, syringe, and medication are being used. (See task 081833-0088.) 
 5. Select and expose the injection site. 
NOTE: The preferred injection sites for insulin are the arms, abdomen, thighs, and buttocks. 
The preferred injection site for heparin is the lower abdominal fat pad, just below the umbilicus. 
 
a. Lateral upper arm. 
 
b. Anterior thigh. 
 
c. Fat pads on the abdomen. 
 
d. Buttocks. 
 6. Position the patient. 
 
a. Upper arm-standing or sitting with the area completely exposed, muscles relaxed, and 
the arm at the side. 
 
b. Outer thigh- lying face up or seated, with the area completely exposed. 
 
c. Abdomen- lying face up, with the area completely exposed. 
 
d. Buttocks- lying face down or leaning forward and supported by a stable object with the 
weight shifted to the leg that will not be injected. The area is completely exposed. 
 
7. Clean the injection site. 
 
a. Open the antiseptic pads package. 
 
b. Begin at the injection site and move the pad outward in a circular motion to a 
circumference of about 2 inches (5cm). 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-349 
 
c. Allow the skin to dry completely before administering injection. 
NOTE: This will avoid a stinging sensation from introducing alcohol into subcutaneous tissue. 
 8. Pull the needle cover straight off without bending or touching the needle. 
WARNING: Do not violate aseptic technique. 
 9. Prepare the skin for the injection. 
 
a. Form a fold of skin at the injection site by pinching the skin gently between the thumb 
and the index finger of the non-dominant hand. 
 
b. Do not touch the injection site. 
 10. Insert the needle. 
 
a. With the dominant hand, position the needle, bevel up, at a 45 degree angle to the skin 
surface. 
 
b. Insert the needle firmly and quickly in one motion into the fatty tissue below the skin. 
 11. Release the hold on the skin. 
NOTE: To help avoid injecting the drug into compressed tissue and irritating the nerve fibers. 
 12. Administer the medication. 
 
a. Aspirate by pulling back slightly on the plunger of the syringe. 
WARNING: Do not aspirate for blood return when giving insulin or heparin. It is not necessary 
with insulin and may cause a hematoma with heparin. 
 
(1) If blood appears, stop the procedure. Go to step 4 and begin the procedure again. 
Use a new needle, syringe, and medication, and select a different injection site. 
CAUTION: If blood appears in the syringe on aspiration, the needle is in a blood vessel. If this 
occurs, stop the injection. Withdraw the needle, prepare another injection with new equipment, 
and inject another site. 
 
(2) If no blood appears, continue the procedure. 
 
b. Using a slow continuous movement, completely depress the plunger, injecting the 
medication. 
NOTE: Rapid pressure may cause a burning pain. 
 
c. After injection, withdraw the needle at the same angle at which it was inserted. 
NOTE: Gently but guickly. 
 
d. Discard syringe with needle attached in sharps container IAW local facilities' standing 
operating procedure (SOP) and infection control guidelines. 
 
e. Place an antiseptic pad (or 2 x 2 gauze pad) over the injection site and gently massage 
the site (unless contraindicated, as with heparin and insulin), to distrbute the medication and 
facilitate absorption. 
 
f. Remove the alcohol pad and check the injection site for bleeding and/or bruising. 
NOTE: Place bandage over site if small amount of bleeding is noted. 
 13. Monitor patient for any adverse reactions. 
 
a. Observe the patient for anaphylactic shock symptoms IAW local SOP. (See task 081833-0031.)

Administer Inhalation Medications 
081-833-0022 
WARNING: The use of inhalers may be contraindicated in patients who cannot form an airtight 
seal around the device and in patients who lack the coordination or clear vision to assemble a 
turbo inhaler. Bronchodilators are contraindicated if the patient has tachycardia or history of 
cardiac arrhythmias associated with tachycardia. 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring inhalation medications. You will need a DA Form 
4678 Therapeutic Documentation Care Plan (Medications) record, SF 510 Nursing Notes, the 
patient's clinical records, a metered-dose inhaler, turbo inhaler or nasal inhaler, prescribed 
medications, disposable gloves, normal saline solution (or another appropriate solution) for 
gargling, pen, spacer, and an emesis basin (optional). You have performed a patient care hand 
wash and are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Administer inhalation medications without causing harm to the patient. 
NOTE: Hand held inhalers use air under pressure to produce a mist containing tiny droplets of 
medication. Drugs delivered in this form (such as mucolytics and bronchodilators) can travel 
deep into the lungs. Because these devices deliver topical medications to the respiratory tract, 
they produce local and systemic effects. The mucosal lining of the respiratory tract absorbs the 
inhalant almost immediately. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Ask the patient about allergies. 
 
a. Check patient's clinical record for listing of allergies. 
 
b. Check patient's wrist band for allergies. 
 2. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
 
a. If more than one inhalation is ordered, advise the patient that there will be at least 2 
minutes before repeating the procedure. 
 
b. If the patient has a steroid inhaler, instruct them that you will use the bronchodilator first 
and then wait 5 minutes before using the steroid. 
NOTE: This allows the bronchodilator to open the air passages for maximum effectiveness. 
 3. Provide privacy for the patient. 
 4. Put on disposable gloves. 
 5. Administer inhaler. 
 
a. Metered-dose inhaler. 
 
(1) Shake the inhaler bottle to mix the medication and aerosol propellant. 
 
(2) Remove the mouthpiece and cap. 
NOTE: Some metered-dose inhalers have a spacer built into the inhaler. Pull the spacer away 
from the section holding the medication canister until it clicks into place. 
 
(3) Insert the metal stem on the bottle into the small hole on the flattened portion of the 
mouthpiece, then turn the bottle upside down. 
 
(4) Have the patient exhale, and then place the mouthpiece in their mouth and instruct 
them to close their lips around it. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-353 
 
(5) Firmly push the bottle down against the mouthpiece, ask the patient to inhale slowly 
and to continue inhaling until their lungs feel full (3 to 5 seconds). 
NOTE: This actions draws the medication into their lungs. 
 
(6) Compress the bottle against the mouthpiece only once. 
 
(7) Remove the mouthpiece from the patient's mouth, and tell them to hold their breath 
for several seconds to allow the medication to reach the alveoli (5 to 10 seconds). 
 
(8) Instruct the patient to exhale slowly through pursed lips to keep the distal bronchioles 
open, allowing increased absorbtion and diffusion of the durg and better gas exchange. 
NOTE: The lungs retain only about 10% of the inhalant; most of the remainder is exhaled, but 
substantial amounts may remain in the oropharynx. 
 
b. Turbo inhaler. 
 
(1) Hold the mouthpiece in non-dominant hand and with dominant hand slide the sleeve 
away from the mouthpiece as far as possible. 
 
(2) Unscrew the tip of the mouthpiece by turning it counterclockwise. 
 
(3) Firmly press the colored portion of the medication capsule into the propeller step of 
the mouthpiece. 
 
(4) Screw the inhaler together again securely. 
 
(5) Holding the inhaler with the mouthpiece at the bottom, slide the sleeve all the way 
down and then up again to puncture the capsule and release the medication. 
NOTE: Do this only once. 
 
(6) Have the patient exhale and tilt their head back. 
 
(7) Tell them to put the mouthpiece in their mouth, close their lips around it and inhale 
once-quickly and deeply through the mouthpiece. 
 
(8) Tell the patient to hold their breath for several seconds to allow the medication to 
reach the alveoli (5 to 10 seconds). 
NOTE: Instruct them not to exhale through the mouthpiece. 
 
(9) Remove the inhaler from the patient's mouth and tell them to exhale as much air as 
possible. 
 
(10) Repeat the procedure until all of the medication in the device is inhaled. 
 
c. Nasal inhaler. 
 
(1) Have the patient blow their nose to clear their nostrils. 
 
(2) Shake the medication cartridge and then insert it into the adapter. 
NOTE: Before inserting a refill cartridge, remove the protective cap from the stem. 
 
(3) Remove the protective cap from the adapter tip. Hold the inhaler with your index 
finger on top of the cartridge and your thumb under the nasal adapter (with your dominant 
hand). The adapter tip should be pointing towards the patient. 
 
(4) Have the patient tilt their head back. 
 
(5) Tell the patient to place the adapter tip into one nostril while occluding the other 
nostril with their finger. 
 
(6) Instruct the patient to inhale gently as he presses the adapter and the cartridge 
together firmly to release a measured dose of medication. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-354 
 
3 May 2013 
 
(7) Tell the patient to remove the inhaler from their nostril and to hold their breath for a 
few seconds (5 to 10 seconds). 
 
(8) Have the patient exhale through their mouth. 
 
(9) Shake the inhaler and have the patient repeat the procedure with the other nostril. 
 6. Have patient gargle with normal saline solution to remove medication from their mouth and 
throat. 
 7. Provide emesis basin if needed. 
 8. Discard inhaler. 
 
a. Turbo inhaler. 
 
(1) Discard the empty medication capsule IAW local facility SOP. 
 
(2) Put the inhaler in its can. 
 
(3) Secure the lid. 
CAUTION: When using a turbo or nasal inhaler, make sure the pressurized cartridge is not 
punctured or incinerated. Store the medication cartridge below 120° F (48. 9° C). 
 
b. Nasal - Remove the medication cartridge and discard IAW local facility SOP. 
NOTE: Let the adapter dry thoroughly before reinserting the cartridge. 
 9. Empty emesis basin and discard IAW local facility SOP. 
 10. Clean equipment. 
 
a. Metered-dose inhaler-rinse the mouthpiece thoroughly with warm water to prevent 
accumulation of residue. 
 
b. Turbo inhaler-rinse the inhaler with warm water at least once per week. 
 
c. Nasal inhaler-wash the nasal adapter in lukewarm water. 
 11. Remove gloves and discard IAW local facility policies and infection control guidelines. 
 12. Perform a patient care hand wash. 
 13. Document procedure on appropriate form IAW local SOP. 
 
a. How well the patient tolerated the procedure. 
 
b. Time and date of the procedure. 
 
c. Medication administered. 
 
d. Patient's response to medication administered.

Treat a Casualty for a Heat Injury 
081-831-0038 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. Always observe body 
substance isolation (BSI) precautions by wearing gloves and eye protection as a minimal 
standard of protection. 
Conditions: A casualty is suffering from a heat injury. All other more serious injuries have been 
assessed and treated. You will need water, a thermometer, intravenous (IV) administration set, 
ringer's lactate or sodium chloride, ice sheets, if available, stethoscope, sphygmomanometer, 
and a DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You are not in a CBRN environment

Treat a Casualty for Insect Bites or Stings 
081-833-0072 
Conditions: You have a casualty with insect bites or stings. You have treated all other 
immediate life threats. You have taken body substance isolation (BSI) precautions. You will 
need normal saline, mild or strong soap cleansing solution, pen, clean (aseptic) tweezers, 
blade, or card (hard plastic i.e. Identification card), sterile 4 x 4 gauze pads, 
sphygmomanometer, stethoscope, and a DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). You are 
not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Treat the casualty for insect bites or stings, without causing further injury. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Expose the injury site. 
NOTE: Remove clothing, rings, watches, and other constricting items that are in the area of the 
bite or sting to prevent circulatory impairment in the event swelling of the extremity occurs. 
 2. Determine the type of insect bite or sting. 
 
a. Gather information from the casualty, ask them if they saw what bit or stung them. 
WARNING: Be alert for indications of casualty developing anaphylaxis such as hoarseness, a 
feeling of swelling or lump in the throat, wheezing and signs and symptoms of shock. 
 
b. If the casualty is unconscious, check for a medical alert bracelet or tag (allergy band). 
NOTE: It is important to determine if the casualty has a history of past reactions to similar bites 
or stings. 
 3. Check the casualty for the signs and symptoms of insect bites and stings. 
 
a. Black widow spider. 
 
(1) A pinprick sensation at the bite site, becoming a dull ache within about 30 minutes. 
 
(2) Severe painful muscle spasms, expecially in the shoulders, back, chest and 
abdomen. 
 
 
(a) Begin in 10 to 40 minutes. 
 
 
(b) Peak in 1 to 3 hours. 
 
 
(c) Persist for 12 to 48 hours. 
 
(3) Rigid, board-like abdomen. 
 
(4) Dizziness, nausea and vomiting and respiratory distress in severe cases. 
 
b. Brown recluse spider.

yellow to dark chocolate brown. It has a distinct groove between its chest and abdominal body 
parts. The characteristic marking is a brown, violin-shaped marking on the upper back. 
 
(1) Casualty seldom recalls being bitten, since bite is painless at first. 
 
(2) Several hours after the bite, it becomes bluish surrounded by a white periphery. 
 
(3) A red halo or “bull’s-eye” pattern appears sometime later. 
 
(4) Within 7-10 days, the bite becomes a large ulcer.

e. Fire ant(s). 
NOTE: Fire ants inject a very irritating toxin into the skin. They bite repeatedly and in a very 
short period of time. Fire ants are known for their aggressive nature and for their bites. A fire ant 
sting is itchy yet painful and very prone to infection. 
 
(1) Intense, fiery, burning pain. 
 
(2) Characteristic circular pattern of bites. 
NOTE: Fire ants bite down into the skin, then sting downwardly as they pivot. 
 
(3) Extremely painful vesicles that are filled with fluid within minutes. 
 
(4) Cloudy, fluid-filled bubble within 2 to 4 hours. 
 
(5) Bubble on red base within 8 to 10 hours.

Treat a Casualty for Snake Bite 
081-833-0073 
Conditions: You have a casualty with a snakebite. You have scanned the ground around the 
area, scene is safe. You have taken body substance isolation, (BSI), precautions. You will need 
normal saline, mild or strong soap cleansing solution, pen, and DD Form 1380 US Field Medical 
Card (FMC). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Provide treatment without causing further injury to the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Expose the injury site. 
WARNING: Each person reacts differently to a snakebite. You should consider the bite from 
any known poisonous snake or any unidentified snake, to be an emergency. 
CAUTION: If the bite cannot be positively identified as nonpoisonous, the bite should be treated 
as a poisonous bite. Do not delay treatment during this step. 
 2. Determine the type of snakebite. 
NOTE: Staying calm and keeping the casualty calm and at rest is critical. 
 
a. Nonpoisonous. 
 
(1) Four to six rows of teeth. 
 
(2) No fangs. 
 
b. Poisonous. 
 
(1) Two rows of teeth. 
 
(2) Two fangs which create puncture wounds. 
WARNING: Exception is the coral snake, a poisonous snake that does not have fangs. It leaves 
a semicircular pattern with its teeth as it "chews" the skin. 
 
(3) Eliptical pupils or vertical slits, much like those of a cat. 
 
(4) Pit between the eye and mouth. 
 
(5) A variety of different-shaped blotches on backgrounds of pink, yellow, olive, tan, 
gray, or brown skin. 
NOTE: The exception to color is the coral snake which is ringed with red, yellow and black. 
 
(6) A triangular head that is larger than the neck. 
 3. Check the casualty for signs and symptoms of a poisonous bite. 
NOTE: The signs and symptoms of a poisonous snakebite generally occur immediately. 
 
a. Noticeable bite on the skin which may appear as nothing more than a discoloration. 
 
b. Pain and swelling in the area of the bite, which may be slow to develop, taking from 30 
minutes to several hours. 
 
c. Rapid pulse and labored breathing. 
 
d. Progressive general weakness. 
 
e. Vision problems (dim or blurred). 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-366 
 
3 May 2013 
 
f. Seizures. 
 
g. Shock. 
 
h. Dizziness or faintness. 
 
i. Fever, chills, or sweating. 
 
j. Nausea and vomiting. 
 
k. Drowsiness or unconsciousness. 
 
l. Paralysis. 
 
m. Coma. 
WARNING: Never delay care and transport in order to capture the snake. 
CAUTION: Do not give the casualty any sedatives, alcohol, food, or tobacco. 
 4. Initiate treatment. 
NOTE: If the dead or captured snake is at the scene, it is not your role to identify the snake, but 
to place it in a sealed container and transport it along with the casualty. 
Never scrub the area or apply a cold pack to snakebites. There may be only one fang mark. 
 
a. Nonpoisonous bite. 
 
(1) Wash the area around the bite gently using a mild or strong soap solution and sterile 
normal saline. 
 
(2) If the casualty has a current tetanus toxoid series, refer the casualty to the medical 
officer. 
 
(3) If the casualty does not have a current tetanus toxoid series or does not know, refer 
the casualty to a medical treatment facility for an immunization. 
 
b. Poisonous bites. 
WARNING: Do not cut into the bite and suction or squeeze the bite site. 
 
(1) Wash the area around the bite gently using a mild or strong soap solution and sterile 
normal saline. 
 
(2) Keep the casualty calm and reassured. 
 
 
(a) Explain to the casualty what will be done. 
 
 
(b) Limit their physical activity. 
 
(3) Keep any bitten extremities immobilized-the application of a splint will help. 
 
(4) Lower the injection site below the level of the heart. 
 
(5) Remove any rings, bracelets, or other constricting items on the bitten extremity. 
NOTE: Removing jewelry or other constricting objects from the casualty's affected limb will help 
in case the limb swells, which would make removal more difficult later. 
 
(6) Call medical direction. 
 
 
(a) Ask the best receiving facility where antivenom will be most readily available to 
treat the casualty. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-367 
 
 
(b) Ask medical direction and follow local protocols in the application of a constricting 
band in the treatment of a snakebite, proximal to the bite. 
 5. Record the procedure on FMC. 
 6. Evacuate the casualty. 
 
a. Rapid transport and administration of antivenom are the most effective interventions for 
the treatment of life-threatening snakebites. 
 
b. While in route observe the casualty carefully for the signs and symptoms of allergic 
reaction, monitoring airway, breathing, circulation, vital signs, distal pulse of the bitten extremity, 
treating for shock, and conserving body heat. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act a the casualty. Simulate a 
snakebite on the casualty’s arm or leg or describe its appearance to the Soldier. Coach the 
casualty on how to answer the Soldier’s questions regarding signs and symptoms such as pain. 
To test step 2, ask the Soldier what type of bite the casualty has. To test step 3, have the 
Soldier tell you the symptoms of a poisonous snakebite. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to treat a casualty for a snakebite.

(2) Surface lesions with shedding of dead tissue, or bleeding lesions. 
 
b. Frostbite is caused by exposure of the skin to cold temperatures that are usually below 
32° F depending on the windchill factor, length of exposure, and adequacy of protection. 
NOTE: The onset is signaled by a sudden blanching of the skin of the nose, ears, cheeks, 
fingers, or toes followed by a momentary tingling sensation. Frostbite is indicated when the face, 
hands, or feet stop hurting. 
 
(1) First Degree. 
 
 
(a) Epidermal injury; limited to skin that has brief contact with cold air or metal. 
 
 
(b) No blister or tissue loss; healing occurs in 7-10 days. 
 
(2) Second Degree.

 2. Treat the cold injury. 
 
a. Chilblains. 
 
(1) Apply local re-warming within minutes. 
CAUTION: Do not treat with ointments. 
 
(2) Protect lesions (if present) with dry sterile dressings. 
 
b. Frostbite. 
CAUTION: Avoid thawing the affected area if it is possible that the injury may refreeze before 
reaching the treatment center. 
 
(1) Apply local re-warming using body heat. 
 
(2) Loosen or remove constricting clothing and remove jewelry. 
CAUTION: Do not massage the skin or rub anything on the frozen parts. 
 
(3) Increase insulation and exercise the entire body as well as the affected body part(s). 
 
(4) Move the casualty to a sheltered area, if possible. 
 
(5) Fingers and toes should be separated and protected with dry sterile gauze. 
 
(6) Protect the affected area from further cold or trauma. 
 
(7) Evacuate the casualty. 
NOTE: For frostbite of a lower extremity, evacuate the casualty by litter, if possible. 
 
CAUTION: Do not allow the casualty to use tobacco or alcohol. 
 
c. Generalized hypothermia. 
 
(1) Moderate. 
 
 
(a) Remove the casualty from the cold environment. 
 
 
(b) Replace wet clothing with dry clothing. 
 
 
(c) Cover the casualty with insulating material or blankets. 
 
 
(d) Avoid unnecessary movement from the casualty. 
NOTE: If far from a medical treatment facility and the situation and facilities permit, immerse the 
casualty in a tub of 104-108° F water. Avoid re-warming with intense sources of heat (campfire). 
 
CAUTION: Do not give the casualty alcohol or caffeine drinks. 
 
 
(e) If casualty is conscious, slowly give high caloric sweet warm fluids.

3-371 
 
 
(f) Wrap the casualty from head to toe. 
 
 
(g) Evacuate the casualty lying down. 
CAUTION: Handle the casualty very gently. 
 
(2) Severe. 
 
 
(a) Cut away wet clothing and replace it with dry clothing. 
 
 
(b) Maintain the airway. (See task 081-831-0018.) 
NOTE: Do not use artificial airways or suctioning devices. 
 
CAUTION: Do not hyperventilate the casualty. Keep the rate of artificial ventilation at 
approximately 8 to 10 per minute. 
o Administer oxygen. 
o Assist with ventilation if the casualty's respiration rate is less than five per minute. 
NOTE: Do not use artificial airways or suctioning devices. 
 
 
(c) Initiate an intravenous (IV) infusion of any crystalloid fluid, warmed up to 109° F . 
Do not infuse cold IV fluids. 
 
 
(d) Evacuate the casualty. 
NOTE: The treatment of moderate hypothermia is aimed at preventing further heat loss and rewarming the casualty as rapidly as possible. Re-warming a casualty with severe hypothermia is 
critical to saving his life, but the kind of care re-warming requires is nearly impossible to carry 
out in the field. Evacuate the casualty promptly to a medical treatment facility. Use stabilizing 
measures en route. 
 
d. Immersion syndrome. 
CAUTION: Never massage the skin. After re-warming the affected part, it may become swollen, 
red, and hot. Blisters usually form due to circulation return. 
 
(1) Dry the affected part immediately and gradually re-warm it in warm air. 
 
(2) Protect the affected part from trauma and secondary infection. 
 
(3) Fingers and toes should be separated and protected with a dry sterile gauze. 
 
(4) Elevate the affected part. 
 
(5) Evacuate the casualty as soon as possible. 
 
e. Snow blindness. Cover the eyes with a dark cloth and evacuate the casualty to a medical 
treatment facility. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation have another Soldier act as the casualty. Select one of the 
types of cold injuries on which to evaluate the Soldier. Coach the simulated casualty on how to 
answer questions about symptoms. Physical signs and symptoms that the casualty cannot 
readily simulate, for example blisters, must be described to the Soldier. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to determine what cold injury the casualty has. After the cold injury 
has been identified, ask the Soldier to describe the proper treatment.

Subject Area 12: Medical Treatment 
Remove a Toenail 
081-833-0196 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring a toenail extraction. You will need a medical officer’s 
order for a toenail extraction, appropriate antimicrobial solution, sterile normal saline or sterile 
water, non adherent dressing, 3-5ml syringe with two long (1-1. 5 inches) needles (25G and 21G 
(gauge)), 1% lidocaine local anesthetic without epinephrine, nail anvil splitter (English), two 
sterile forceps or hemostats (straight), sterile cotton-tipped applicators, penrose drain used as a 
tourniquet, 4 x 4 sterile gauze sponges, dressing materials, infectious waste receptacle, sharps 
container, tape, and SF 600 (Chronological Record of Medical Care), and pen. You are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform partial or complete toenail removal in accordance with (IAW) established 
protocols without causing harm or further injury to patient. 
NOTE: When irritation and/or infection are more widespread or include the entire toe, removal 
of a portion of the nail and debridement of the inflamed tissue may be required. Toenail removal 
may be total or partial. Total nail removal is rarely needed but may be used when infection of 
both lateral nailfolds is present, particularly if the condition is present for more than a month. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Solicit a patient history and verify patient’s signature on consent form. 
 2. Gather equipment. 
 3. Prepare the patient. 
 
a. Explain procedure. 
 
b. Place the patient supine with knees flexed and feet flat. 
 
c. Cleanse the digit with an antimicrobial scrub. 
 
d. Exsanguinate the toe by squeezing or wrapping, and apply a tourniquet at the base of 
the toe. 
 
e. Apply sterile drapes to completely surround the wound and to cover all unprepared areas 
adjacent to the site. 
 
f. Administer local anesthetic by ring block technique. 
 
(1) Digital cutaneous nerves run along the medial and lateral aspects of each digit and 
can be blocked at any level above the distal phalanx. 
 
(2) Use the 25 gauge needle to raise a skin wheal by administering approximately 
0. 25ml of the anesthetic directly over the lateral and medial cutaneous nerve. 
 
(3) Change to 21 gauge needle and advance the needle perpendicular to the nerve until 
bone is reached; inject approximately 1ml of the anesthetic. 
 
(4) Slide the needle up and down on the dorsal and volar aspects of the digit; injecting 
approximately 0. 5ml of the anesthetic in each side. 
 
(5) Discard used needles and syringe in sharp’s container immediately after use.

a. Perform a patient care hand wash and put on sterile gloves. 
 
b. Once anesthesia has been achieved, use a straight hemostat to firmly secure a wide 
rubber band around the base of the digit to serve as a tourniquet. 
 
c. Stabilize the digit in the non-dominant hand. 
CAUTION: Take care to perform a controlled division along the longitudinal lines of the nail for 
several millimeters past the proximal nailfold (cuticle). 
 
d. Insert a single blade of the other straight hemostat between the nail bed and the nail to 
loosen and lift the nail. Split the nail with nail splitter in a longitudinal direction (distal to proximal) 
to include the base of the nail that rests beneath the cuticle. 
NOTE: An English anvil nail splitter is desirable to begin the procedure, but sharp scissors or a 
No. 11 blade will work. 
 
e. With the second straight hemostat, grasp the portion of the loosened nail and remove it 
using a steady pulling motion with a simultaneous upward twist of the hand toward the affected 
side completely removing the section of the nail. 
 
f. Debride the nail groove. 
 
(1) Inspect the remnant to be certain that the entire piece of nail of has been removed as 
desired. 
 
(2) Sharply remove any remaining or swollen/heaped-up skin and all hyperkeratotic 
debris. 
 
g. Remove the tourniquet and assess for hemostasis. 
 
h. Apply a topical antibiotic ointment (not containing neomycin) to the nail bed and cover 
the digit with a sterile nonadherent dressing, followed by a dry sterile wrap or tubular gauze and 
tape in place. 
 
i. Discard soiled/blood soaked gauze and disposable drapes in infectious waste receptacle, 
IAW infection control guidelines and local facilities SOP. 
 
j. Cleanse all instruments used in procedure IAW local facilities SOP. 
 
k. Remove gloves. 
 
l. Wash hands. 
 5. Complete toenail removal. 
 
a. Perform a patient care handwash and put on sterile gloves. 
 
b. Once anesthesia has been achieved, use a straight hemostat to firmly secure a wide 
rubber band around the base of the digit to serve as a tourniquet. 
 
c. Stabilize the digit in the nondominant hand. 
CAUTION: It is important to completely free the proximal nail at its base (under the edge of the 
cuticle) to allow removal and to expose the germinal tissue of the nail bed. 
 
d. Insert a single blade of the other straight hemostat (or the periosteal elevator) between 
the nail bed and the toenail to loosen and lift the nail; advance the instrument with a continued 
upward pressure against the nail and away from the nail bed to minimize injury and bleeding.

Initiate Treatment for a Paronychia 
081-833-0024 
Conditions: You have a patient with a paronychia. You will need a scalpel handle, scalpel 
blades of various sizes, antibiotic ointment, sterile dressing, gloves, and SF 600 (Medical 
Record - Chronological Record of Medical Care). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Provide drainage for a patient's paronychia without causing further injury to the 
patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Recognize signs and symptoms of a paronychia. 
 
a. Swelling and tenderness of the soft tissue along the base or side of a fingernail. 
 
b. Pain, often around a hangnail. 
 
c. Infection begins as a cellulitis and may form an abscess. 
 2. Obtain a history of the patient's complaint. 
 3. Gather the materials for the procedure. 
 4. Perform a patient care handwash. 
 5. Put on gloves. 
 6. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
 7. Drain the paronychia. 
 
a. Often, an incision is unnecessary. Instead, insert the tip of a No. 11 blade approximately 
5 mm under the surface of the nail, uplifting the cuticle, thus providing an escape for the 
collected suppurative material. 
NOTE: This procedure alone provides for adequate drainage in most paronychias. 
 
b. Allow the pus to drain. 
 
c. Irrigate the cavity with normal saline. 
 
d. Apply antibiotic ointment and absorbent dry, sterile dressing. 
 
e. Instruct the patient to perform frequent soaks in warm tap water at home and continue to 
keep the wound covered as long as drainage persists. 
NOTE: Culture and antibiotic therapy are usually unnecessary unless the patient shows signs of 
systemic infection. 
 8. Remove gloves. 
 9. Instruct the patient to follow up in 24-48 hours. Instruct the patient to follow up earlier if 
there are signs of systemic infection. 
 10. Record all treatment given on SF 600. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
This task is best evaluated by verbalization of the steps. Give the Soldier a simulated patient 
and a scenario in which he must drain a paronychia.

Insert a Urinary Catheter 
081-833-3017 
Conditions: You have a medical officer's order for urinary catheterization of an adult patient. 
You will need an adult disposable #14 to #16 (French) (latex or silicone) catheter, drainage bag 
attached set, sterile gloves, betadine swabs, benzalkonium chloride antiseptic cleaning agent 
(in case patient has an allergy to betadine or iodine) located inside kit, a penlight/flashlight or 
standing lamp, chux pads, sheet for draping, pen and an SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological 
Record of Medical Care). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Insert a urinary catheter without violating aseptic technique or causing further injury 
to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Perform a patient care handwash. 
 2. Confirm the patient’s identity and inquire about allergies to betadine solution or betadine 
prep swabs and allergies to tape, in accordance with, (IAW) local standard operating 
procedures (SOP). 
 
a. Use two patient identifiers. 
 
(1) Ask patient state his full name. 
 
(2) Ask patient his date of birth (DOB). 
 
b. Check patient for allergy band. 
 
c. Check patient’s chart for any known drug allergies. 
 3. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
NOTE: Patient will feel reassured if the procedure is explained and if they are handled gently 
and considerately. 
 4. Position the patient. 
NOTE: Elevate bed to a height/position of comfort for you while performing procedure and raise 
the top two side rails for patient safety. 
 
a. Provide privacy for the patient. 
 
b. Place patient in a supine position with knees bent, hips flexed and feet resting on the 
bed. 
 5. Direct light for visualization of genital area. 
 6. Position chux pads between patient's legs and under the hips. 
 7. Put on sterile gloves. 
 8. Prepare catheterization kit. 
 
a. Open catheter tray using aseptic technique. 
 
b. To create the sterile field, open the prepackaged kit or equipment tray and place it 
between the female patient’s legs. 
 
c. For male patient place it next to their hip. 
 9. Place the sterile drape under the patient's hips. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-380 
 
3 May 2013 
 10. Drape the patient's lower abdomen with the sterile fenestrated drape so that only the 
genital area remains exposed. 
NOTE: Take care not to contaminate your sterile gloves. 
 11. Open the rest of the kit or tray. 
 12. Tear open the packet of antiseptic cleaning agent. 
NOTE: Be careful not to spill the solution on the equipment. 
 
a. Saturate the sterile cotton balls or applicators. 
 
b. Open the packet of water-soluable lubricant and apply it to the catheter tip. 
 
c. Make sure all tubing ends remain sterile and make sure the clamp at the emptying port of 
the drainage bag is closed to prevent urine leakage from the bag. 
 
d. Before inserting the catheter, inflate the balloon. 
 
(1) Attach the prefilled syringe to the luer-lock. 
 
(2) Push the plunger and check for seepage as the balloon expands. 
 
(3) Aspirate the water to deflate the balloon. 
NOTE: Beware that some manufacturers recommend not inflating the balloon prior to insertion 
because of the risk of microtears that may cause infection. If you are unsure, check the 
manufacturer's instructions that are included with the kit. 
 13. Insert the catheter. 
NOTE: Bacteria that normally colonize the distal urethra may be introduced into the bladder 
during or immediately after catheter insertion. 
 
a. Female. 
 
(1) Separate labia majora and the labia minora as widely as possile with the thumb, 
middle and index fingers of your non-dominant hand so you have a full view of the urinary 
meatus. 
 
(2) Keep the labia well separated thrughout the procedure so they don't obscure the 
urinary meatus or contaminate the area when it's cleaned. 
NOTE: This manuever helps prevent labial contamination of the catheter. 
 
WARNING: Do not contaminate your sterile gloved hand. 
 
(3) With your dominant hand, use a sterile, cotton-tipped applicator (or pick up a sterile 
cotton ball with the plastic forceps). 
 
 
(a) Wipe one side of the urinary meatus with a single downward motion. 
 
 
(b) Dispose of the cotton-tipped applicator or cotton ball after use. 
 
 
(c) Secure another sterile applicator or cotton ball and wipe the other side of the 
urinary meatus with a single downward motion disposing after use. 
 
 
(d) Secure a third sterile applicator or cotton ball and wipe directly over the meatus 
and dispose after use. 
WARNING: Too large of a catheter may cause painful distention of the meatus and cause 
damage to the uropithelium. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-381 
 
(4) Introduce the well lubricated catheter 2-3 inches (5-7. 5 cm) into the urethral meatus 
using strict aseptic technique, while continuing to hold the labia apart. 
NOTE: If the catheter is inadvertently inserted into the vagina, leave it there as a landmark. 
Remove gloves, obtain antother sterile set and then begin the procedure over again using new 
sterile supplies. 
 
 
(a) Avoid contaminating surface of the catheter. 
 
 
(b) Make sure that the catheter is not too large or too tight at the urethral meatus. 
 
 
(c) Advance the catheter almost to the bifurcation. 
NOTE: If catheter is correctly placed, you should see a urine flow through tubing and into the 
drainage bag. 
 
b. Male. 
 
(1) Hold the penis with your non-dominant hand. 
 
(2) If the patient is uncircumcised, retract the foreskin. 
 
(3) Gently lift and stretch the penis to a 60 to 90 degree angle. Continue holding the 
penis this way throughout the procedure to straighten the urethra and maintain a sterile field. 
 
(4) Use your dominant hand to clean the glans with a sterile cotton-tipped applicator or a 
sterile cotton ball held in the forceps. 
 
(5) Clean in a circular motion, starting at the urinary meatus and working outward, 
disposing the applicator or cotton ball after use. 
 
(6) Repeat the cleaning procedure two more times, disposing of the cotton-tipped 
applcator or cotton ball after each use. 
 
(7) Inject 5-10 ml of water-soluable lubricant or water-soluable 2% lidocaine jelly directly 
into the urethra. 
 
(8) Pick up the catheter with your dominant hand, and prepare to insert the lubricated tip 
into the urinary meatus. 
WARNING: Never force a catheter during insertion. Maneuver gently as the patient bears down 
or coughs. If you still meet resistance, stop and notify the medical officer. 
 
(9) To facilitate insertion by relaxing the sphincter, ask the patient to cough as you insert 
the catheter. 
 
 
(a) Tell him to breath deeply and slowly to further relax the sphincter and spasms. 
 
 
(b) Hold the catheter close to its tip to ease insertion and control its direction. 
 
(10) Advance the catheter to the bifurcation. 
NOTE: With some commercially prepared catheterization kits, the catheter is pre-connected to 
the drainage tubing of the collecting bag. 
 
 
(a) Check for urine flow. 
 
 
(b) If foreskin was retracted, replace it to prevent compromised circulation and painful 
swelling. 
WARNING: Never inflate the balloon without first establishing urine flow. 
CAUTION: Make sure the catheter is draining properly before inflating the balloon, then 
withdraw the catheter slightly.

 14. Inflate balloon (male and female patients). 
NOTE: Inflation of balloon will keep the catheter in place in the bladder. 
 
a. Push the plunger of your prefilled syringe. 
 
b. Inject 5-10 ml of sterile water, or IAW with manufacturer's directions when urine stops 
flowing. 
 
c. Remove syringe after inflation of balloon from the luer-lock post of catheter. 
 
d. Hang the collection bag below bladder level to prevent urine reflux into the bladder and 
to facilitate gravity drainage of the bladder. 
 15. Tape and secure the catheter. 
 
a. Tape catheter to thigh to prevent possible tensionon the urogential trigone in female 
patients. 
 
b. Tape the catheter to the male patient's abdomen or thigh to prevent pressure on the 
urethra at the penoscrotal junction. 
NOTE: The penis may be positioned up or down (facing the patient's head or feet), depending 
upon the patient's diagnosis, the medical officer's order, and/or the patient's comfort preference. 
 
c. Alternatively, you can secure the catheter to the patient's thigh using a leg band with a 
Velcro closure. 
NOTE: Securing of catheter with Velcro closure decreases skin irritation, especially in patients 
with long term indwelling catheters. 
 
CAUTION: Do not secure the drainage bag to the bed side rails or loop the drainage tubing over 
or through the side rails. 
 16. Secure the drainage bag to the side of the bed on the bottom of the bed frame. 
 17. Reposition the patient. 
 
a. Lower patient's bed back down and make sure brake is in locked position.

Insert a Nasogastric Tube 
081-833-3022 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring a nasogastric (NG) tube. You will need a NG tube 
(single lumen Levin or double-lumen Salem sump tube), water soluble lubricant, suction 
equipment if ordered, clamp for tubing, towel, tissues, and emesis basin, glass of water and 
straw, tincture of benzoin, hypoallergenic tape: 1/2 inch and 1 inch, bio-occlusive transparent 
dressing, irrigating set with 20-ml syringe or a 50-ml catheter-tip syringe, clean stethoscope, 
tongue blade, penlight, disposable gloves, normal saline, pen, and SF 510 (Nursing Notes) or a 
SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care). You have performed a patient 
care handwash and you are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Insert a nasogastric (NG) tube without causing injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Assemble equipment. 
NOTE: NG tubes may be contraindicated in patients with nasopharyngeal or esophageal 
obstruction, severe, uncontrolled coagulopathy or severe maxillofacial trauma. 
 2. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
 
a. Ask patient if they have ever had nasal surgery, trauma, a deviated septum or bleeding 
disorder. 
 
b. Explain that mouth breathing, panting, and swallowing will make it easier to insert the 
tube. 
 
c. Tell the patient that the tube will be inserted along the nasal passage. 
 
d. Explain that the procedure may cause him or her to gag and bring tears to his or her 
eyes. 
 3. Put on gloves. 
 4. Place patient in a sitting or high-Fowler's position; place a towel across the chest. 
NOTE: This will facilitate the passage of the tube into the esophagus. 
 
a. If the patient is unconscious, place him on his left side with the uppermost arm flexed 
across the abdomen or supported on the body and hip. 
 
b. Determine with the patient what sign he might use, such as raising the index finger, to 
indicate "wait a few moments" because of gagging or discomfort. 
 
c. Remove dentures; place emesis basin and tissues within patient's reach. 
NOTE: Dentures may become loose and interfere with tube insertion. 
 5. Inspect the tube for defects; look for partially closed holes or rough edges. 
NOTE: Irrigation and suction may be affected by a defective tube. 
 6. Place rubber tubing in ice-chilled water for a few minutes to make the tube firmer. 
NOTE: Plastic tubing may already be firm enough; if too stiff, dip in warm water. 
 7. Determine the length of the tube needed to reach the stomach. 
NOTE: Determining the correct length will prevent coiling of the tube in the stomach or having 
the tube end in the esophagus. 
 
a. Measure the patient's nose, earlobe and xiphoid (NEX), and mark the tube appropriately. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-385 
 
b. The distance from the nose to the earlobe is the first mark on the tube. This 
measurement represents the distance to the nasal pharynx. 
 
c. When the tube reaches the xiphoid process (tip of the breast bone) a second mark is 
made on the tube. This measurement represents the length required to reach the stomach. 
 8. Inspect the nostrils with a penlight, observing for any obstruction. 
 
a. Have the patient blow nose to clear nostrils. 
 
b. Occlude each nostril and have the patient breathe. 
 9. Insert NG tube. 
 
a. Coil the first 3-4 inches (7. 5-10 cm) of the tube around your fingers. 
NOTE: This curves tubing and facilitates tube passage. 
 
b. Lubricate the coiled portion of the tube with water-soluble lubricant, avoid occulding the 
tube's holes. 
NOTE: Lubrication reduces friction between the mucous membranes and tube and prevents 
injury to the nasal passages. Using a water-soluble lubricant prevents oil aspiration pneumonia 
if the tube accidentally slips into the trachea. 
 
c. Tilt the patient's head back before inserting tube into nostril and gently pass the tube into 
the posterior nasopharnynx, directing downward and backward toward the ear. 
NOTE: The passage of the tube is facilitated by following the natural contours of the body. The 
slower the advancement of the tube at this point, the less likelihood of putting pressure on the 
turbinates, which could cause pain and bleeding. 
 
d. When the tube reaches the pharynx, the patient may gag; allow patient to rest for a few 
moments. 
 
e. Have the patient tilt the head slightly forward. 
 
(1) Offer several sips of water through a straw or have patient suck on ice chips if not 
contraindicated. 
 
(2) Advance the tube as patient swallows. 
NOTE: Flexed head position partially occludes the airway, and the tube is less likely to enter the 
trachea. Swallowing closes the epiglottis over the trachea and facilitates passage of the tube 
into the esophagus. 
 
CAUTION: If there are signs of distress, such as gasping, coughing or cyanosis, immediately 
remove the tube. 
 
f. Gently rotate the tube 180 degrees to redirect the curve. 
NOTE: This prevents the tube from entering the patient's mouth. 
If obstruction appears to prevent tube from passing, do not use force. Rotating the tube may 
help. If unsuccessful, remove tube and try other nostril. 
 
g. Continue to advance tube gently each time the patient swallows. 
 
h. Continue to advance tube until the tape mark reaches the patient's nostril. 
 10. Check tube placement. 
 
a. Check whether the tube is in the stomach. 
 
(1) For a conscious patient, ask the patient to talk. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-386 
 
3 May 2013 
 
(2) For an unconscious patient, use the tongue blade and penlight to examine the 
patient's mouth to assess proper placement of the NG tube through the posterior pharnyx. 
NOTE: The presence of stomach contents in the tube or syringe indicates correct placement. 
 
b. Auscultation. 
 
(1) Position the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the patient's stomach (about 2 inches 
below the sternum). 
 
(2) Inject 10 cc of air into the tube. 
 
(3) Listen for the sound of the air entering the stomach (gurgling or whooshing sound) 
which indicates correct tube placement. Proceed to step 14 if placement is correct. 
 
(4) Check for tube placement in the trachea if air is not heard entering the stomach. 
 
 
(a) Reinject 10 cc of air into the tube. 
 
 
(b) Auscultate over the lung field. 
 
 
(c) Remove the tube if air injection is heard over the lungs. 
 
(5) Repeat steps to reinsert the tube. 
 11. Secure the tube to the patient's nose with the tape and wrap the two ends of tape around 
the tube. 
 12. Connect the tube to the suction apparatus, if ordered. 
 13. Remove gloves and wash hands. 
 14. Report and record the procedure on SF 510 or SF 600. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use a simulation device capable of accepting a nasogastric 
tube. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier the simulated patient requires a nasogastric tube to be inserted.

Insert an Orogastric Tube 
081-833-0187 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring an orogastric tube. You will need surgical lubricant, a 
large (50 or 60 cc) syringe, an orogastric tube, a small (10 to 20 cc) syringe, a container for 
contaminated waste, adhesive tape, stethoscope, gloves, water, small cup, a drinking straw, 
pen and SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care). You have performed 
a patient care hand wash and you are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Insert an orogastric tube without causing further harm to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Determine if the indicators for performing orogastric intubation are present. 
 
a. Patient with mid-facial trauma. 
 
b. Gastric distention which impedes airway, breathing and circulation (ABC). 
 
(1) Full arrest. 
 
(2) Near drowning. 
 
c. Intestinal obstruction. 
 
d. Preoperative and postoperative care. 
 
e. Patient requires a gastrointestinal lavage. 
 
(1) Overdose. 
 
(2) Gastrointestinal bleeding. 
 
f. Patient requires a gavage. 
 
(1) Comatose patients. 
 
(2) Debilitated patients. 
 
g. Need to analyze stomach contents. 
 
(1) Patient may be bleeding internally. 
WARNING: Orogastric tube insertion is contraindicated in patients with esophageal strictures, 
ingested caustics, significant facial or head trauma or patients with bleeding disorders. 
CAUTION: Insertion of an orograstric (OG) tube into trachea/lung, patient may experience 
respiratory distress. If this occurs at any time during the procedure, remove the tube 
immediately. 
 
(2) Overdose. 
WARNING: Wear gloves for self-protection against transmission of contaminants whenever 
handling body fluids. 
 2. Put on gloves. 
 3. Identify the patient. 
 
a. Ask the patient's name and date of birth (DOB). 
 
b. Check the identification band against the chart as appropriate.

3-389 
 4. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
 
a. Explain the reason for the orogastric tube. 
 
b. Explain the procedure and assess their capability of cooperating with the procedure. 
NOTE: It is not advisable to explain the procedure too far in advance because the patient's 
anxiety about the procedure may interfere with its success. 
 
c. Tell the patient that a tube will be inserted along the oral passage and that he may feel 
some discomfort. 
 
d. Tell the patient that breathing through the nose/mouth, panting, and swallowing can help 
in passing the tube. 
NOTE: It is important that the patient relax, swallow and cooperate during the procedure. 
 
e. Ask the patient about any history of oral or esophageal injury. 
 
f. Tell the patient that the tube must be placed about 20 inches down the oral passageway. 
 
g. Tell the patient that the procedure may cause him to gag. 
 5. Examine the patient's oral cavity. Ensure that there are no obstructions in the oral cavity. 
 6. Position the patient. 
 
a. Position the responsive, awake, and alert patient in the Fowler's position. Elevate the 
head of the bed to about 30 to 45 degrees. 
 
b. Place a comatose or unconscious patient in the lateral position (turn the patient onto his 
side). 
 7. Prepare the equipment. 
 
a. Select the correct type and size of orogastric tube to use. 
 
b. Cut four or five pieces of tape 3 to 4 inches long and attach one end of each where they 
will be easily accessible. 
 
c. Unwrap the tube from the plastic wrapper. 
 
d. Measure the combined distance between the corner of the mouth to the ear lobe to the 
xiphoid process. Mark this spot with a small piece of temporary tape. 
NOTE: Each patient will have a slightly different terminal insertion point. Measurements must be 
made for each individual's anatomy. 
 
e. Lubricate 5 to 6 centimeters of the distal end of the tube with water-soluble lubricant. 
NOTE: The tube slides in more easily if well lubricated. The mucosa is less likely to be damaged 
during insertion. 
 8. Insert the lubricated tip of the tube into the oropharynx. 
 9. Advance the tube into the esophagus. 
 10. Continue advancing the tube until the tape marker touches the lips. 
 11. Check and confirm the tube is correctly placed by at least two methods. 
 
a. Aspiration of stomach contents. 
NOTE: Stomach contents will appear cloudy, green, tan, off white, bloody or brown. 
 
b. Injection of 30-60 ml of air into tube as you auscultate for the sound of air over the 
epigastric region.

Measure a Patient's Intake and Output 
081-833-0006 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring measurement of their intake and output. You will need 
a calibrated graduated container, gloves, common serving items, specimen collection container, 
urinal, bedpan, urinary drainage bag, nasogastric drainage container, pen, and DD Form 792 
(Twenty-Four Hour Patient Intake and Output Worksheet). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Accurately measure and record the patient's fluid intake and output on appropriate 
forms. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
 
a. Inform the patient of the length of time during which the intake and output will be 
measured and the purpose of taking the measurements. 
 
b. Tell the patient of any medical officer's order on fluid intake, such as forcing fluids or 
restricting the amount of intake. 
 2. Tell the patient what types of items require intake and/or output measurement. 
 
a. Intake measurement. 
 
(1) Items that are naturally fluid at room temperature such as jello, ice cream, ice, and 
infant cereals. 
 
(2) Fluids consumed with and between meals, such as water, coffee, tea, broth, juice, 
milk, milk shakes, and carbonated beverages. 
 
(3) IV infusion fluids, blood and blood products. 
 
(4) Oral liquid medications. 
 
(5) Irrigating solutions that are not returned. 
 
b. Output measurement. 
 
(1) Urine. 
 
(2) Liquid stool. 
 
(3) Vomitus. 
 
(4) Drainage from wounds, chest tubes and suction devices. 
 3. Tell the patient to use specified containers such as a bedpan, specimen collection container 
or urinal to save all fluid output. 
 4. Measure the intake. 
 
a. Calculate the oral fluid intake. 
NOTE: Check the water pitcher at the beginning and end of each shift. Check the meal tray for 
the amount of liquids consumed before removing it from the room. 
 
(1) Note the type and size of the oral fluid containers. 
 
(2) Check the container to find the fluid capacity. 
 
(3) Check the "Equivalents Table" on DD Form 792. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-397 
NOTE: If an unmarked container is not listed on DD Form 792, fill it with water and pour its 
contents into a graduated container to check its capacity. 
 
b. Calculate the amount of IV solution or blood given. 
 
c. Calculate the amount of any irrigating solutions that are not returned, if applicable. 
 
(1) Subtract the amount of solution returned from the known amount used for the 
irrigating procedure. 
 
(2) Record the difference as intake. 
 5. Record, in cubic centimeters (cc), the fluid intake under the appropriate heading on DD 
Form 792. 
NOTE: To convert ounces to cc, multiply the number of fluid ounces by 30. Example: 12 fluid 
ounces multiplied by 30 equals 360 cc. One millimeter (ml) is approximately equal to one cc. 
 6. Measure the output. 
 
a. Put on gloves. 
 
b. Record the level of output (urine, liquid, stool or emesis) in a graduated container. 
NOTE: If it is not possible to weigh or measure liquid stool, estimate the amount IAW local SOP. 
Estimate the amount of solid stool IAW local SOP. 
 
c. Estimate the amount of wound drainage, if present, IAW local SOP. 
 
d. Estimate any output not in a container, such as on the floor, skin or sheets, IAW with 
local SOP. 
 
e. Observe characteristics of the output. 
 
(1) Color and odor of urine. 
 
(2) Color, odor and consistency of stool. 
 
(3) Color and consistency of nasogstric drainage. 
 7. Remove gloves and perform a patient care hand wash. 
 8. Record in cc the amount and characteristics of output under the appropriate headings on 
the DD Form 792. 
NOTE: If no output was available to measure, enter this information in the "Remarks" section of 
the DD Form 792. 
 9. Compute accumulated intake and output totals at the end of the 24-hour period and record 
on the appropriate forms IAW local SOP. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: If the performance of this task must be simulated for training and evaluation, premeasure 
at least two fluid items into common serving utensils. The Soldier will use them as the remains 
of a patient's simulated intake. You may also partially empty a bag or bottle of intravenous (IV) 
solution and have the Soldier calculate the amount of intravenous intake. Have at least two 
premeasured containers of simulated waste fluid to use for simulated output. Have the Soldier 
explain steps 1 through 3 to you. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier to measure and record the intake and output of a specified patient.

Perform a Gastric Lavage 
081-835-3005 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring gastic lavage. You will need an Ewald tube, 
nasogastric tubes, Y-connector, clamp or hemostat, water-soluble lubricant, 50 cc catheter-tip 
syringes, basins, IV pole, waterproof pads (chux), towels, sphygmomanometer, stethoscope, 
thermometer, graduated containers, ice, prescribed lavage solution, gloves, face shield, 
Yankauer or tonsil-tip suction device, suction apparatus, labeled specimen container, pen, 1 1/2 
inches hypoallergenic tape, the patient's clinical record and a DD Form 1380 US Field Medical 
Card (FMC). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform the gastric lavage IAW the medical officer's orders and without causing 
further injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Assemble the necessary equipment and set it up at the patient's bedside. 
 
a. Ensure that there is enough irrigating solution on hand. 
NOTE: In most cases, the medical officer's order will be to lavage "until clear". Lavage will 
continue until the stomach contents return clear (nothing is returned but the irrigating solution 
itself). This requires preparation of at least 6 liters of the prescribed irrigating solution (usually 
normal saline). 
 
b. Ensure that ice or chilled solution is available when the medical officer orders "ice 
lavage". 
NOTE: When lavage is done to control gastric bleeding, the order is usually for "ice lavage". 
Chilling the irrigating solution promotes vasoconstriction, thereby helping to control bleeding. 
 2. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
 3. Establish baseline vital signs. 
 4. Take body substance isolation precautions (BSI). 
 5. Position the patient. 
 
a. A patient who is alert should be placed in the Fowler's or semi-Fowler's position. 
 
b. A patient who is not alert, or too weak to sit, should be positioned on the left side, with 
the head of the bed elevated 15 degrees. 
NOTE: This left lateral recumbent position will allow the tip of the tube to lie in the greater 
curvature of the stomach. 
 
c. Drape the towel or waterproof pad (chux) over the patient's chest. 
 
d. If the patient wears dentures, remove them. 
 6. Insert the appropriate tube if one is not already in place. 
 
a. For a stomach wash, the medical officer will specify insertion of large lumen nasogastric 
tube or the Ewald stomach tube. 
NOTE: The Ewald stomach tube is normally inserted through the mouth rather than the nose, 
because it is a large bore tube. When the lavage tube passes the posterior pharynx, help the 
patient into a Trendelenburg position and turn him on his left side in a three-quarter prone 
posture. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-400 
 
3 May 2013 
 
b. For control of gastric bleeding, the medical officer will specify insertion of a large lumen 
nasogastric tube. 
CAUTION: Gloves and eye protection should be worn for self-protection against transmission of 
contaminants, spills and splatters. 
 
c. In the event of severe bleeding, as in the case of esophageal varices, the medical officer 
will specify insertion of a nasogastric tube that has gastric and esophageal balloons (Blakemore 
tube, for example). 
NOTE: In any situation, a large lumen tube is indicated. Particles of food, mucous, or blood may 
occlude the lumen of a small tube. 
 7. Aspirate all stomach contents. 
 
a. Using a 50 cc syringe, aspirate stomach contents and place the aspirate in a measured 
container. 
 
b. Repeat until all stomach contents have been aspirated. 
 
c. Record the total amount as output on the I&O worksheet. 
 
d. Save the aspirate for disposition as directed by the medical officer. 
 8. Instill the irrigating solution, using the method specified by the medical officer's order or 
local SOP. 
 
a. Syringe method. Using a 50 cc catheter-tip syringe, instill 100 cc of the solution. 
(Instillation and withdrawal are repeated 100 cc at a time, until clear or IAW medical officer's 
order). 
CAUTION: When using the funnel method, it is imperative that the patient be carefully assessed 
for abdominal distention. The size and tolerance of the patient will determine how much fluid 
can be instilled at one time. 
 
b. Funnel method. Using a funnel (or syringe barrel), instill up to 500 cc of the solution by 
pouring it slowly into the funnel. 
 9. Withdraw the irrigating solution. 
 
a. Syringe method. 
 
(1) Using a 50 cc catheter-tip syringe, withdraw all the irrigating solution and stomach 
contents. 
 
(2) Place the aspirate into a measured container. 
 
(3) Note the amount and character of the aspirate. 
NOTE: If syringe aspiration is difficult, or no aspirate can be obtained, the gastric tube may be 
resting against the gastric mucosa. Reposition the patient and aspirate again. If aspiration is still 
difficult, reposition the tube by advancing or withdrawing it slightly. 
 
b. Funnel method. 
 
(1) Lower the funnel end of the tube below the level of the patient's stomach to facilitate 
gravity drainage. 
NOTE: If the solution does not begin to drain by gravity, aspirate with a syringe (creating a 
siphon effect) to start the backflow of solution. If gravity drainage cannot be established, 
withdraw the solution by the syringe method.

Conditions: You have a medical officer’s order for removal of an indwelling catheter. The 
patient has been draped for privacy. You will need gloves, 10 ml luer-lock syringe, paper towels, 
bedpan, waterproof pad (chux), and SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical 
Care). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Remove a urinary catheter without violating aseptic technique or causing further 
injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Perform a patient care hand wash. 
 2. Assemble the equipment at the patient’s bedside. 
 3. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
 
a. Tell the patient he will feel slight discomfort. 
 
b. Tell him that you will check him periodically during the first 6 to 24 hours after catheter 
removal to make sure he resumes voiding. 
 4. Put on gloves. 
NOTE: Do not cut the catheter. The balloon may not deflate completely when cut. 
 5. Place chux pad underneath patient’s buttocks. 
 6. Clamp the catheter. 
NOTE: Damage to the urethra can occur if the balloon is not completely deflated. 
 7. Offer the patient the bedpan. 
 8. Remove the tape that attaches the catheter to the patient’s leg.

Obtain an Electrocardiogram 
081-835-3007 
Conditions: You have a patient who requires an electrocardiogram (EKG). You will need an 
EKG machine, EKG recording paper, disposable pregelled electrodes, alcohol prep pads, 4 x 4 
gauze pads, towels, tape, Optional Form (OF) 520(Medical Record – Electrocardiographic 
Record), pen, SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care), and optional 
equipment such as clippers, razor and a marking pen. You have performed a patient care hand 
wash, explained the procedure to the patient, taken body substance isoloation precautions (BSI) 
and you are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Obtain an EKG in accordance with (IAW) the medical officer's order, local facilities 
standing operating procedures (SOP), without causing harm or injury to the patient. 
NOTE: Confirm the patient's identity using two patient identifiers IAW local protocol. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Prepare the equipment. 
 
a. Place the EKG machine close to the patient's bedside. 
 
b. Read the manufacturer's instructions for the proper use of the equipment on hand. 
 
c. Plug in the machine and turn it on. 
 
d. Allow it to perform self-checks, if computerized, or warm up for 5 minutes if not 
computerized. 
NOTE: If patient is already connected to a cardiac monitor, remove the electrodes to 
accommodate the precordial leads and minimize electrical interference, such as equipment, 
fixtures and power cords. 
 2. Prepare the patient. 
 
a. Provide for the patient's privacy. 
 
b. Ask patient about allergies to adhesive paste and gels. 
 
c. Provide a female chaperone, if necessary, for female patients. 
 
d. Provide a chest drape for female patients. 
 
e. Ask or assist the patient to remove wristwatch, shoes, socks or hose, and all clothing 
from the waist up. 
 
f. Ensure that the patient's body is not in contact with any metal objects, and that all limbs 
are firmly supported. 
NOTE: Some metal objects, watches, or jewelry may interfere with the accurate recording of the 
electrical impulses. 
CAUTION: If the bed or examination table is too narrow, place the patient's hands under their 
buttocks to prevent muscle tension. Also use this technique if the patient is shivering or 
trembling. 
 
g. Ask or assist the patient to lie supine on the bed or examination table. 
NOTE: Patient's arms and legs should be relaxed to minimize muscle trembling, which can 
cause electrical interference. Make sure their feet are not touching the bed board. 
 3. Apply limb electrodes. 
 
a. Select flat, fleshy areas to place the electrodes. Avoid muscular and bony areas. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-407 
NOTE: If the patient has an amputated limb, choose a site on the stump. 
 
b. Clean the site for electrode placement by wiping with an alcohol prep pad to remove 
dead skin and oils as needed. 
NOTE: An area of broken down or irritated skin should not be used for the electrode connection. 
If an area is excessively hairy, clip it. 
 
c. Peel off the contact paper of the disposable electrodes. 
 
(1) Check the gel for moistness. 
 
(2) If gel is dry, discard electrode and replace with a fresh one. 
 
(3) Apply electrodes directly to the prepared site. 
NOTE: To guarantee the best connection to the leadwire, position disposable electrodes on the 
legs with the lead connection pointing superiorly. 
 
d. Position the electrodes. 
 
(1) Secure the leg electrodes on the medial or lateral aspect of the calf. 
 
(2) Secure the arm electrodes on the arm or forearm, ensuring that the connections are 
not on, or adjacent to, an intravenous (IV) site. 
 
(3) Connect the limb leadwires to the electrodes. 
 4. Apply the chest electrodes. 
 
a. Expose the patient's chest. 
 
b. If necessary, clip the hair from an area about 4 inches (10cm) in diameter around each 
electrode site. 
 
c. Clean the sites for electrode placement by wiping with an alcohol prep pad to remove 
dead skin and oils as needed. 
 
d. Position the electrodes, being careful to place them over the intercostal spaces and not 
directly over the ribs. (See Figure 3-8.) 
NOTE: The standard EKG machine utilizes 12 "leads". these leads represent paths of electrical 
activity, and are designated as leads I, II, III, AVR, AVL, AVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6. Do 
not confuse these 12 leads with the 10 electrodes (sometimes referred to as "leads") that are 
attached to the patient.

e. Connect the chest leadwires to the electrodes. 
NOTE: If your patient is a female, be sure to place the chest electrodes below the breast tissue. 
In a large-breasted female, you may need to displace the breast tissue laterally. 
 5. Obtain the EKG tracing. 
NOTE: Check to see that the paper speed selector is set to the standard 25 mm/second and 
that the machine is set to full voltage. 
 
a. Operate the equipment IAW the manufacturer's operating instructions. 
 
b. The machine will record a normal standardization mark-a square that's the height of two 
large squares or 10 small squares on the recording paper. 
NOTE: If any part of the waveform extends beyond the paper when you record the EKG strip, 
adjust the normal standardization to half-standardization. Be sure to note this adjustment of the 
EKG strip because this will need to be considered when interpreting the results. 
 
c. Enter the appropriate patient identification data. 
 
d. Ask the patient to relax and breathe normally. 
NOTE: If a patient's respirations distort the recording, ask them to hold their breath briefly to 
reduce baseline wander in the tracing. 
 
e. Tell the patient not to talk when you record their EKG.

WARNING: If the patient has a pacemaker, you can perform an EKG with or without a magnet 
according to the medical officer's order. 
CAUTION: Be sure to note the presence of a pacemaker and the use of the magnet on the 
strip. 
 
f. Press the AUTO button and observe the tracing quality. 
 
g. Ensure a complete and readable EKG tracing. 
 6. Observe and assess the EKG tracing as it is printed and take appropriate action. 
 
a. Observe the tracing for the presence of the normal waves in each heartbeat. 
NOTE: Each heartbeat is normally represented as 5 major waves: P, Q, R, S, and T. The Q, R, 
and S waves all represent the same portion of the heartbeat and are referred to as a unit: QRS 
complex. Occasionally, a 6th wave will appear. It is referred to as the U wave. Although it does 
not always appear, its presence is perfectly normal. (See Figure 3-9.) 
 
Figure 3-9. EKG tracing 
 
b. Observe for irregularities that are a result of artifact, interference, or equipment 
malfunction. 
 
(1) Check the patient's position. 
 
(2) Check the placement of the electrodes. 
 
(3) Obtain new equipment if necessary. 
 
(4) Repeat the EKG. 
 
c. Observe for irregularities of the heart's rhythm. 
 
(1) Notify the medical officer IMMEDIATELY if you note the presence of any of the lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmias. 
NOTE: Ventricular arrhythmias are characterized by an ectopic (out of place) focus in the wall of 
the ventricle which initiates ventricular contraction. A distorted and prolonged QRS complex 
occurs as a result of the aberrant conduction pathway. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-410

(a) Ventricular Fibrillation. V-Fib is an irregular and chaotic ventricular arrhythmia 
characterized by a rapid rate and disorganized conduction of impulses throughout the 
ventricular myocardium. Death will occur within minutes without immediate defibrillation or 
initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). (See Figure 3-10.) 
 
Figure 3-10. Ventricular fibrillation 
 
 
(b) Ventricular Tachycardia. V-Tach is a ventricular arrhythmia characterized by broad 
QRS complexes and a regular rate that falls between 100 to 200 beats per minute. Immediate 
correction is essential, as V-Tach may lead to V-Fib. (See Figure 3-11.) 
 
Figure 3-11. Ventricular tachycardia 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-411 
 
 
(c) Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs). PVCs occur when an ectopic focus in 
one of the ventricles initiates contraction of the ventricles. When this occurs, there will be no 
atrial contraction associated with that beat, and no P wave will be seen in front of the QRS 
complex. A PVC usually has a tall, broad QRS complex. PVCs that come from different focal 
points in the ventricle will have different shapes on the EKG. PVCs may be harmless, but they 
may also be the forerunners of V-Tach and V-Fib. For this reason, even occasional PVCs 
should be considered important. PVCs are considered life threatening when they are frequent 
(more than 6 per minute), when they occur in groups of two or more (back-to-back), when they 
are multi-focal, and when they occur ina pattern of every other beat or every third beat 
(bigeminy, trigeminy). (See Figure 3-12.) 
 
Figure 3-12. Premature ventricular contractions 
 
(2) Notify the medical officer of any other irregularities of the heart's rhythm after you 
have completed the tracing, but before you remove the electrodes from the patient. (A second 
tracing may be ordered.) 
 7. Calculate the heart rate and report any abnormalities. 
 
a. Time is measured on the horizontal axis of the EKG graph paper. (See Figure 3-13.) 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-412 
 
3 May 2013 
 
Figure 3-13. EKG graph paper 
 
(1) Each small box = 0. 04 seconds. 
 
(2) Each large box = 5 small boxes = 0. 20 seconds. 
 
(3) 5 large boxes = 1. 0 second = 1 inch of graph paper. 
 
(4) 300 large boxes = 60 seconds = 1 minute. 
 
b. Calculate the heart rate using one of the following methods: 
 
(1) Count the number of large boxes between any two R waves and divide that number 
into 300. Example: 300 divided by 5 large boxes = 60. 
 
(2) Count the number of R waves in a 6 second strip and multiply by 10. Example: 6 R 
waves X 10 = 60. 
 
c. Notify the medical officer of irregularities. 
 
(1) Bradycardia-less than 60 beats per minute. 
 
(2) Tachycardia-more than 100 beats per minute. 
NOTE: Paper speed must be set on the normal (25 mm/sec) setting. 
 8. Remove the electrodes. 
 
a. Remove all the chest and limb electrodes. 
 
b. Wipe the patient's skin with a damp towel to remove the excess electrode paste. 
NOTE: Instruct the patient to wash with soap and water as soon as convenient to avoid skin 
irritation from the EKG paste. 
 9. Ask or assist the patient to get dressed. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

 10. Prepare the report. 
 
a. Remove the EKG tracing from the machine. 
 
b. Mark the EKG tracing printout with the patient's identification. 
 
c. Attach the completed OF 520 to the EKG tracing printout. 
 
d. Make proper distribution of the report as directed by the medical officer's order or IAW 
local SOP. 
 11. Store the equipment. 
 
a. Dispose of used electrodes IAW local SOP. 
 
b. Restock the machine with EKG paper, electrodes, alcohol prep pads, towels, and 
drapes, as necessary. 
 
c. Clean and store the machine in the area and manner directed by local policy. 
 12. Document the procedure and significant nursing observations on the SF 600 or

Perform Wound Irrigation 
081-833-0012 
CAUTION: All body fluids should be considered as potentially infectious so always observe 
body substance isolation (BSI) precautions by putting on clean gloves and an eye shield or face 
guard as a minimal standard of protection. 
Conditions: You need to perform a wound irrigation. You will need waterproof pads (chux), 
irrigating syringe, examination gloves, sterile gloves, mask, prescribed irrigating solution, sterile 
dressing, catch basin, sterile gauze sponges, a sterile solution basin, and SF 600 (Medical 
Record- Chronological Record of Medical Care). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform a wound irrigation without violating aseptic techniques or causing further 
injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Identify the patient. 
 2. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
 3. Provide privacy, if possible, and position the patient at an angle that allows the irrigating 
solution to run from the upper end of the wound downward. 
 4. Place the waterproof protective pad and clean basin or irrigating pouch directly under the 
area to be irrigated. 
 5. Drape the patient with a bath blanket to expose only the wound. 
 6. Remove the used outer dressing and discard in a marked biohazard bag. Discard gloves 
and wash hands. 
 7. Prepare the irrigation equipment. 
 
a. Open irrigation tray, using sterile technique, (establish a sterile field using the wrapper of 
the sterile solution basin). 
 
b. Verify the prescribed irrigating solution. 
 
c. Open the irrigation solution; place the cover on the table, with the inside facing upward. 
 
d. Carefully pour the solution from the supply bottle into the irrigation bottle/syringe, pour 
solution with the bottle label facing your palm (if the bottle has been opened previoiusly, pour off 
a small amount of the solution into a trash receptacle). 
 
e. Leave the cover off of the irrigation supply bottle, with the inside of the cover pointing 
upward. 
 8. Put on a mask and eye protection. 
 9. Open the sterile dressing tray if one is to be used. 
 10. Put on sterile gloves. (See task 081-831-0008.) 
 11. Use sterile forceps to remove the inner dressings. 
 12. Carefully assess the amount and character of drainage, the size and condition of the 
wound and surrounding tissue. 
 13. Irrigate the wound. 
 
a. Hold the syringe just above the wound's top edge without touching it, and force fluid into 
the wound, slowly and continuously. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-415 
 
b. Use enough force to flush out debris, but do not squirt or splash fluid. 
 
c. Irrigate all portions of the wound (do not force solution into the wound's pockets). 
 
d. Continue irrigating until the solution draining from the wound's bottom end is clear. 
 
e. Repeat steps 13a and 13c until the wound is clear of debris and/or drainage. 
 
f. Observe the drainage for blood or characteristics such as unusual color, odor, or 
consistency. 
NOTE: If signs of infection are observed, notify the medical officer immediately. 
 
CAUTION: Use extra care when irrigating a wound in which an abscess has formed. Check all 
internal surfaces of the wound to inspect for "sinus tract" (resembles tunnels in which purulence 
or "pus" may be collected). This may require using the gloved hand or a sterile object to gently 
pull back the flesh. Be careful not to tear healing tissue. 
 14. Dry the wound and apply a sterile dressing. 
 
a. Using sterile 4 x 4 pads, gently pat the wound's edges (unless the wound is to have a 
wet-to-dry dressing; then dry only the surrounding skin). Work from cleanest to most 
contaminated. 
NOTE: Moving from clean to contaminated helps to prevent the spread of pathogens. If the 
wound is dry, the dressings will remain dry longer and contamination will not spread. 
 
b. Apply a sterile dressing to the wound. (See task 081-833-0010.) 
 
c. Remove the catch basin and waterproof pad (chux), if they are still in place. 
 15. Remove the mask, eye protection, and gloves. 
 16. Reposition the patient for comfort, if necessary. 
 17. Clean and store the equipment IAW local SOP. 
 18. Perform a patient care handwash. (See task 081-831-0007.) 
 19. Record the procedure on the SF 600. 
 20. Do not violate aseptic technique or cause further injury to the patient. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: If the performance of this task must be simulated for training or evaluation, have another 
Soldier act as the patient. Designate a wound site or use a moulage kit or similar material to

Operate an IV Infusion Pump 
081-833-0102 
WARNING: Pumps have various detectors and alarms that automatically signal or respond to 
the completion of an infusion, air in the line, low battery power, and occlusion or inability to 
deliver at the set rate. Depending on the problem, these devices may sound or flash an alarm, 
shut off or switch to keep vein open (KVO) rate. 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring an intravenous (IV) infusion pump. You will need the 
patient's clinical records, a peristaltic pump, IV pole, IV solution, sterile administration set, sterile 
peristaltic tubing or cassette (if needed), alcohol pads, adhesive pads, adhesive tape, pen and 
SF 510 Nursing Notes . You have performed a patient care hand wash and are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Operate an IV infusion pump without causing further harm/injury to the patient IAW 
manufacturer's instructions and local SOP. 
NOTE: Various types of IV pumps electronically regulate the flow of IV solutions or drugs with 
great accuracy. Volumetric pumps used for high pressure infusion of drugs or for highly 
accurate delivery of fluids or drugs, have mechanisms to propel the solution at the desired rate 
under pressure. The peristaltic pump applies pressure to the IV tubing to force the solution 
through it. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Attach the pump to the IV pole. 
 2. Swab the port on the IV container with alcohol. 
 
a. Insert the administration set spike and fill the drip chamber completely to prevent air 
bubbles. 
 
b. Prime the tubing and close the clamp. 
 
c. Follow the manufacturer's instruction for placement of tubing. 
NOTE: If your facility utilizes a bar code automated pump, scan your badge, the patient's ID 
(identification) bracelet, and the patient ID on the medication bag. 
 3. Position the pump on the same side of the bed as the IV or anticipated venipuncture site. 
NOTE: If necessary, perform the venipuncture. 
 4. Plug in the machine. 
 5. Attach the tubing to the catheter hub. 
 6. Turn the machine on. 
 
a. Press the START button. 
 
b. Set the appropriate dials on the front panel to the desired infusion rate and volume. 
NOTE: Always set the volume dial to 50ml less than the prescribed volume or 50ml less than 
the volume in the container so that you can hang a new container before the old one empties. 
 7. Confirm that the right information is displayed on the pump and push the RUN button. 
NOTE: This can be verified by having a second person check the pump with you and the 
medical officer's order. 
 8. Check the patency of the IV line and watch for infiltration. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-424 
 
3 May 2013 
NOTE: Keep in mind that infiltration can develop rapidly with infusion by volumetric pump 
because the increased subcutaneous pressure will not slow the infusion rate until significant 
edema occurs. 
 9. Tape all connections. 
 10. Turn on the alarm switches. 
NOTE: Explain the alarm system to the patient. This will prevent anxiety when a change in 
infusion activates the alarm. 
 
WARNING: Check the manufacturer's recommendations before administering opaque fluids, 
such as blood, because some pumps fail to detect such fluids and others may cause hemolysis 
of infused blood. 
 11. Monitor the pump and the patient frequently. 
NOTE: Monitoring frequently will ensure the device's correct operation, flow rate and rapid 
detection of infiltration and such complications such as infection and air embolism. 
 12. Record procedure on SF 510. 
Evaluation Preparation: None.

Operate a Glucometer 
081-833-0257 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring a blood glucose to be determined. You have the 
patient’s clinical records, a portable blood glucose meter, blood glucose test strips, disposable 
gloves, disposable lancets or mechanical blood-letting devices, alcohol wipes, 2 x 2 gauze, pen, 
and SF 510 Nursing Notes. You have performed a patient care hand wash and you are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Operate a glucometer in accordance with (IAW) local standard operating 
procedures (SOP), and infection control guidelines, without causing harm to the patient. 
NOTE: When using a blood glucose meter, calibrate it and run it with a quality control test to 
ensure accurate test results. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for calibration. If 
appropriate, ensure that the code strip number on the test strip matches the code number on 
the meter. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Confirm the patient’s identity. 
 
a. Ask the patient to state their full name. 
 
b. Ask the patient their DOB (date of birth). 
 
c. Check patient’s wristband against clinical records. 
 2. Explain the procedure to the patient. 
 3. Select the puncture site (usually the fingertip or earlobe for an adult or a child). 
 4. Put on gloves. 
 5. Wipe the puncture site with an alcohol pad, and allow the site to dry completely. 
 6. Turn on the glucometer. 
NOTE: The meter will indicate its readiness for testing blood glucose by message or symbol. 
Some meters require that the glucose strip be inserted at this time. 
 7. Collect sample from the fingertip with disposable lancet. 
 
a. Position the lancet on the lateral side of the patient’s fingertip perpendicular to the lines 
of the fingerprints. 
NOTE: This avoids the most sensitive area of the fingertip. 
 
b. Pierce the skin sharply and quickly to minimize the patient’s anxiety and pain and to 
increase blood flow. 
 
c. Alternatively, you can use a mechanical blood-letting device, which uses a spring-loaded 
lancet. 
 
d. Obtain a large, hanging drop of blood. 
NOTE: After puncturing the fingertip, do not squeeze the puncture site, to avoid diluting the 
sample with tissue fluid. Some glucose meters require that the test area be covered completely 
for accurate results. Others use only a small drop of blood inserted at the side of the test strip. 
 
e. Apply a drop of blood to the test area of the test strip carefully. 
 
f. After collecting the blood sample, briefly apply pressure to the puncture site. 
NOTE: Applying pressure will prevent painful extravasation of blood into the subcutaneous 
tissues. You may ask an adult to hold a gauze pad firmly over the puncture site until the 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-430

Test a Stool Sample 
081-833-0256 
Conditions: You have a patient stool sample requiring testing for occult blood. You will need 
the patient’s clinical records, bedpan or specimen collection container, test kit, gloves, tongue 
blade or other wooden applicator, pen, and SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of 
Medical Care). You have performed a patient care hand wash and you are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Test a stool sample in accordance with (IAW) local infection control policy and 
standard operating procedures (SOP) without causing harm to the patient. 
NOTE: Fecal occult blood tests are valuable for determining the presence of occult blood 
(hidden GI (gastrointestinal) bleeding) and for distinguishing true melena from melena-like 
stools. Certain medications, such as iron supplements and bismuth compounds, can darken 
stools so that they resemble melena. Occult blood tests are particularly important for early 
detection of colorectal cancer because 80% of patients with this disorder test positive. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Verify patient’s identity according to your facility’s policy. 
 
a. Ask patient to state their full name. 
 
b. Ask patient their date of birth. 
 2. Explain the procedure to the patient and check their history for medications that may 
interfere with the test. 
 
a. If patient is ambulatory and has bathroom privileges (BRP) place a clean specimen 
collection container in toilet to obtain specimen. 
 
b. Inform patient that specimen collection container is for stool specimen only not urine. 
 
c. If patient is unable to use toilet or bedside commode, offer bedpan in order to obtain 
stool specimen. 
NOTE: Inform patient to NOT place toilet tissue in bedpan with specimen and DO NOT urinate 
in bedpan with specimen. Tell patient to notify you when specimen is ready. 
 3. Put on gloves. 
 4. Collect stool sample. 
NOTE: Do not collect routine samples during or until 3 days after a female’s menstrual period to 
avoid a false-positive test from contamination of the specimen. 
CAUTION: Make sure stool specimens are not contaminated with urine, soap solution, or toilet 
tissue, and test them as soon as possible after collection. 
 5. Test stool sample. 
NOTE: Check the expiration date on the Hemoccult slides and developer, and protect the 
unused slides from heat, moisture, light, and chemicals. 
 
a. Open the flap on the slide package. 
 
(1) Use a wooden applicator to apply a thin smear of the stool specimen on the guaiacimpregnated filter paper exposed in box A. 
 
(2) Apply a second smear from another part of the specimen to the filter paper exposed 
in box B. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-440 
 
3 May 2013 
 
(3) Allow the specimen to dry for 3 to 5 minutes. 
 
b. Open the flap on the reverse side of the slide package. 
 
(1) Place two drops of Hemoccult developing solution on the paper over each smear. 
 
(2) A blue reaction will appear in 30 to 60 seconds if the test is positive. 
NOTE: Ingestion of 2 to 5 ml of blood, such as from bleeding gums or active bleeding form 
hemorrhoids, may produce a false positive. 
 6. Record the results and discard the slide package. 
 7. Remove and discard your gloves and wash your hands. 
 8. Document findings on an SF 600. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, this test is best verbalized.

Irrigate an Obstructed Ear 
081-833-0059 
Conditions: You have an order to irrigate an obstructed ear. You will need an irrigating syringe, 
catch basin, irrigating solution, towels, gauze sponges, and otoscope set. You are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Irrigate the obstructed ear until the obstructing material is removed from the 
external ear or until the prescribed amount of solution is used. Perform the procedure without 
causing further injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Gather the irrigation equipment. 
NOTE: Common solutions used to irrigate the ear include water, normal saline, hydrogen 
peroxide and water, and prescribed medication solution. Alcohol may be used to shrink 
vegetable matter (associated with pediatric patients) and make it easier to expel. Oil or viscous 
lidocaine may be used for other foreign bodies to make them slippery. 
 2. Perform a patient care hand wash. (See task 081-831-0007.) 
 3. Warm and test the solution. 
 
a. Warm the solution to about body temperature (95° F to 105° F) by placing the solution 
container in a container of warm water. 
CAUTION: Cold solutions are not only uncomfortable but may cause dizziness or nausea as a 
result of stimulation of the equilibrium sensors in the semicircular canals. 
 
b. Test the temperature of the solution by running a small amount of it on the inner wrist. 
 4. Identify the patient and explain the procedure. 
 
a. Tell the patient that some discomfort may be experienced when the solution is instilled. 
CAUTION: If the patient moves when the solution is instilled, the syringe may damage the ear 
canal or tympanic membrane. 
 
b. Emphasize to the patient that he must remain as still as possible. 
 5. Insert the otoscope speculum into the external ear canal. 
 
a. Position the patient to allow a good view into the ear. 
 
b. Tilt the patient's head toward the shoulder opposite the ear to be irrigated. 
 
c. Straighten the external ear canal by gently pulling the outer ear upward and backward for 
an adult or downward and backward for a child. 
NOTE: Use the largest speculum that will fit comfortably in the patient's ear. 
 
d. Turn on the otoscope light and insert the speculum just inside the opening of the ear. 
NOTE: To avoid causing pain, the speculum should be inserted gently and not too far into the 
ear canal. 
 
e. View the ear canal by looking through the lens of the otoscope. 
 6. Check for abnormalities. 
 
a. Check the external ear canal for redness, swelling, drainage, or foreign bodies. 
 
b. Check the tympanic membrane (TM) for any abnormal conditions.

NOTE: A normal eardrum is slightly cone-shaped, shiny, translucent, and pearly grey. 
 
(1) A blue, yellow, amber, red, or pink eardrum indicates disease or infection. 
 
(2) A bulge in the eardrum indicates possible pus or fluid in the middle ear. 
CAUTION: If an abnormal condition of the TM is suspected, do not irrigate the ear. To do so 
could cause pain and carry debris or infectious discharge into the middle ear. Report the 
condition to the supervisor immediately. 
 
(3) A hole or tear indicates rupture of the TM. 
 7. Position the patient sitting or lying with the head slightly tilted toward the affected side. 
NOTE: Do not tilt the head toward the unaffected side, as this interferes with the return of the 
irrigating solution. 
 8. Drape the patient's shoulder and upper arm area under the affected ear. 
WARNING: If a cotton-tipped applicator is used to clean the ear, make sure it does not stick far 
enough into the ear to rupture the TM. 
 9. Clean the external ear and the entrance to the ear canal with 4 x 4 gauze sponges slightly 
moistened with the irrigating solution. 
 10. Fill the irrigating syringe. 
 11. Test the flow of solution from the syringe by expelling a small amount back into the 
solution container. 
 12. Position the catch basin firmly against the neck just under the affected ear. 
 13. Straighten the external ear canal by gently pulling the outer ear upward and backward for 
an adult or downward and backward for a child. 
 14. Irrigate the patient's ear. 
WARNING: Never allow the syringe to completely block the ear canal. If space is not left around 
the tip, the solution will not be able to return, and undue pressure will build up in the canal. 
 
a. Place the tip of the irrigating syringe just inside the ear, with the tip directed toward the 
roof of the ear canal. 
 
b. Depress the bulb or plunger of the syringe. 
 
(1) Direct a slow, steady stream of solution against the roof of the ear canal. 
 
(2) Repeat the procedure until the foreign body is removed, the solution returns free of 
wax or debris, or the proper amount of solution has been used. 
 15. Remove the catch basin and dry the external ear with a gauze sponge. 
 16. Instruct the patient to continue tilting the head toward the affected side for a few minutes 
to allow any remaining solution to drain from the ear. 
 17. Remove the drapes from the patient. 
 18. Dispose of, or clean and store, the equipment. 
 19. Perform a patient care handwash.

Remove a Patient's Ring 
081-833-0195 
Conditions: You have a patient who requires a ring to be removed. You will need a Penrose 
drain, water-soluble lubricant, and a 25 inch length of umbilical tape or string, or thick silk 
suture. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Remove the patient's ring without causing further injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Lubricate the digit with a water-soluble lubricant and apply traction on the ring while turning 
in a circular motion. 
NOTE: Frequently a ring must be removed to prevent laceration of tissue or vascular 
compromise. 
 2. Attempt to remove the ring using the string-wrap method. 
 
a. Wrap the penrose drain circumferentially around the finger in a distal to proximal 
direction to reduce soft tissue swelling. For maximal effect, the wrap should stay in place for a 
few minutes. 
 
b. A 20 to 25 inch piece of string, umbilical tape or thick silk suture is first passed between 
the ring and the finger. If there is marked soft tissue swelling, the tip of a hemostat may be 
passed under the ring to grasp the string and pull it through the ring. 
 
c. The distal string is wrapped clockwise around the swollen finger (proximal to distal) to 
include the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and the entire swollen finger. 
 
(1) The wrapping is begun next to the ring and should be snug enough to compress the 
swollen tissue. 
 
(2) The successive loops of the wrap are placed next to each other to keep any swollen 
tissue from bulging between the strands. 
 
d. When the wrapping has been completed, the proximal end of the string is carefully 
unwound in the same clockwise direction, forcing the ring over that portion of the finger that has 
been compressed by the wrap. 
 3. If unsuccessful, a ring cutter should be used if there is excessive swelling. 
 
a. The ring cutter has a small hook that fits under the ring and serves as a guide for a sawtoothed wheel that cuts the metal. 
 
b. The cut ends of the ring are spread using large hemostats and the ring is removed. 
 4. Do not cause further injury to the patient. 
Evaluation Preparation: None.

Subject Area 16: CBRN 
Provide Treatment for a Blood Agent (Hydrogen Cyanide) Casualty in the Field 
081-833-0276 
CAUTION: Blood agent (hydrogen cyanide) causes symptoms ranging from convulsions to 
coma. After inhaling a high concentration of blood agent, a person may become unconscious 
and die within minutes. Blood agents in high concentration act quickly and death may result in 
15 seconds. These agents release an odor of bitter almonds or peach kernels; however, 
approximately 50% of the population is genetically unable to detect the odor of cyanide. Anyone 
smelling the odors should mask immediately. 
Conditions: You are in a chemical environment and have a casualty who is lying on the ground 
wearing protective overgarments, overboots, and mask carrier. You are wearing MOPP level 4. 
The casualty is displaying the signs and symptoms of blood agent poisoning. You will need 
ventilation equipment (if available), and DD Form 1380 US Field Medical Card (FMC). 
Standards: Complete all the steps necessary to treat a blood agent casualty in the field, without 
causing further injury to the casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Check for signs and symptoms of blood agent poisoning. 
NOTE: Cyanide causes very few signs and symptoms in man. 
 
a. Moderate, from low concentration. 
 
(1) Vertigo. 
 
(2) Nausea and vomiting. 
 
(3) Transient increase in rate and depth of breathing. 
 
(4) Headache. 
 
(5) Eye irritation. 
NOTE: Above symptoms may progress to severe effects if exposure continues. The time of 
onset of these effects depends on the concentration, but is often within minutes after exposure. 
 
b. Severe, from high concentration. 
 
(1) Intense irritation of the eyes, nose, and airways. 
 
(2) Transient increase in rate and depth of breathing, after 15 seconds of exposure. 
 
(3) Violent convulsions after 30 seconds of exposure. 
 
(4) Respiratory arrest after 2 to 4 minutes of exposure. 
 
(5) Coma. 
 
(6) Cardiac arrest after 4 to 8 minutes of exposure. 
 2. Manage a casualty exposed to blood agents. 
NOTE: Management of cyanide poisoning begins with self protection. 
 
a. Immediately mask and remove the casualty from the contaminated site. 
 
b. With liquid exposure, wet clothing should be removed. 
 
c. Skin should be washed with soap and water. 
NOTE: A casualty that has ingested cyanide does not require decontamination.

Provide Treatment for a Radiation Casualty 
081-833-0280 
Conditions: You encounter a casualty with symptoms consistent with radiological exposure. 
You will need a fully stocked aid bag, intravenous (IV) administration equipment and fluids, 
oxygen, suction and ventilation equipment (if available), selected medications, documentation 
forms, and personal chemical protective equipment. You are in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Provide treatment for a radiation casualty. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Perform an assessment of the casualty to identify any conventional injuries. (See task 081833-0155.) 
NOTE: When assessing casualties during nuclear detonation and radiation injuries, it is 
important to realize that this is a multiple-casualty incident and should be approached from a 
triage perspective. 
 2. Recognize the course of radiation sickness on various systems in the body. 
 
a. Hematopoietic (bone marrow and blood cells). 
 
(1) Initial stage (occurs 1 hour to 2 days after exposure) - symptoms are anorexia, 
nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, clotting disorders, and possible uncontrolled hemorrhage. 
 
(2) Latent stage (lasts 1 to 6 weeks) - casualty may appear and feel well, although stem 
cells are dying. 
 
b. Gastrointestinal (bowel). 
 
(1) Initial stage (lasts about 2 days) - nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, 
fluid loss, malaise and dehydration. 
 
(2) Latent stage (lasts less than 1 week) - casualty may appear and fell well, although 
cells lining the GI are dying. 
 
c. Cardiovascular (CV)/central nervous system (CNS). 
 
(1) Initial stage (occurs within minutes of exposure and lasts for minutes to hours) - rapid 
onset of incapacitation, cardiovascular collapse, confusion, burning or "on fire" sensation with 
high doses. 
 
(2) Latent stage (may last for hours) - casualty may return to partial functionality. 
 
d. Skin - symptoms reddening (erythma). 
NOTE: Duration of symptoms vary with the level of exposure; at low doses incapacitation should 
not be severe enough to warrant evacuation. 
 
e. Affect on overall body during clinical phase. 
NOTE: Symptoms frequently occur in the whole-body irradiated casualties within the first few 
hours of post exposure. 
 
(1) Nausea and vomiting occur with increasing frequency as the radiation exceeds 100200 centigrays (cGy). 
 
 
(a) Onset may be as long as 6 to 12 hours post exposure. 
 
 
(b) Vomiting within the first hours is associated with fatal doses. 
 
(2) Hyperthermia. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-455 
 
 
(a) Significant rise in body temperature within the first few hours of potentially lethal 
radiation injury. 
 
 
(b) Fever and chills are associated with severe and life-threatening radiation dose. 
 
(3) Erythema. 
NOTE: Developed within the first day of post exposure if casualty received a whole-body dose 
of more than 1000-2000 cGy. Erythema is restricted to the affected area. 
 
(4) Hypotension. 
 
 
(a) A noticeable decline in systemic blood pressure if received a lethal dose of wholebody radiation. 
 
 
(b) Severe hypotension after irradiation is associated with a poor prognosis. 
 
(5) Neurologic dysfunction. 
 
 
(a) Almost all persons who demonstrate obvious signs of damage to the central 
nervous system within the first hours post exposure have received a lethal dose. 
 
 
(b) Symptoms include mental confusion, seizures, and coma. 
 3. Treat conventional injuries first. 
 4. Remove the casualty's clothing. (See task 081-833-0095.) 
 5. Wash exposed body surfaces with soap and water. (See task 081-833-0095.) 
 6. Start an IV. (See task 081-833-0033.) 
 7. Administer antibiotics as appropriate. 
 8. Provide supportive care for the casualty depending on the situation. 
NOTE: The amount of supplies required by radiation casualties can exceed the capabilities of 
small clinics. Consider the chance of survival of the casualty and the amount of supplies on 
hand when providing supportive care for the casualties. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
The task is best evaluated by performance of the steps. Give the Soldier a simulated casualty 
and a scenario in which he must manage casualties exposed to ionizing radiation.

Performance Steps 
 1. Assess the casualty for the signs and symptoms of nerve agent poisoning. 
NOTE: If the casualty has been exposed to vapor or aerosol, the pupils will become pinpointed 
immediately. However, if the nerve agent is absorbed through the skin only or by ingesting 
contaminated food or water, the pinpointing of the pupils may be delayed or absent. 
 
a. Vapor exposure. 
NOTE: Effects from vapor exposure will occur within seconds to minutes after being exposed. 
Some of the respiratory distress from a mild exposure will spontaneously decrease within 15 to 
30 minutes after termination of exposure. 
 
(1) Mild (small exposure). 
NOTE: Exposure to small amounts of vapor for a brief period usually causes effects in the eyes, 
nose, and lungs. 
 
 
(a) Unexplained runny nose. 
 
 
(b) Unexplained sudden headache. 
 
 
(c) Sudden and excessive salivation (drooling). 
 
 
(d) Difficulty in seeing (dimness of vision and miosis (constricted pupils)). 
 
 
(e) Tightness in the chest or difficulty in breathing. 
 
 
(f) Stomach cramps. 
 
 
(g) Nausea with or without vomiting. 
 
 
(h) Tachycardia or bradycardia. 
 
(2) Severe (large exposure). 
NOTE: Effects may occur after one breath but normally take place within several seconds of a 
large vapor exposure. 
 
 
(a) All or most of the mild and moderate symptoms. 
 
 
(b) Fatigue and weakness. 
 
 
(c) Red eyes with tearing. 
 
 
(d) Convulsions (severe muscular twitching). 
 
 
(e) Copious secretions from nose, mouth and lungs. 
 
 
(f) Strange or confused behavior.

(g) Wheezing, dyspnea, and coughing. 
 
 
(h) Severely pinpointed pupils. 
 
 
(i) Vomiting. 
 
 
(j) Involuntary urination and defecation. 
 
 
(k) Sudden loss of consciousness. 
 
 
(l) Respiratory failure. 
 
 
(m) Bradycardia. 
 
 
(n) Flaccid paralysis. 
 
b. Skin (percutaneous) exposure. 
NOTES: 1. It is difficult to separate this type of exposure into categories due to the continued 
absorption of nerve agent into skin layers. Due to continued absorption, the effects from the 
nerve agent may be progressive in nature. They may occur from minutes up to 18 hours after 
exposure and continue even after the skin has been decontaminated. 2. The greater the amount 
of exposure to nerve agent, the shorter the onset time of symptoms with increased severity. 
 
(1) Mild exposure. 
 
 
(a) Localized sweating at the exposure site. 
 
 
(b) Muscular twitching at the exposure site. 
 
 
(c) Stomach cramps,nausea and vomiting. 
 
 
(d) Fatigue. 
 
 
(e) Weakness. 
 
(2) Severe exposure. 
 
 
(a) All or most of the mild symptoms. 
 
 
(b) Sudden loss of consciousness. 
 
 
(c) Vomiting. 
 
 
(d) Convulsions and severe muscle twitching. 
 
 
(e) Flaccid paralysis. 
 
 
(f) Loss of bladder and bowel control. 
 
 
(g) Severe breathing difficulty or cessation of respiration. 
NOTE: Death would be the result of complete respiratory system failure. 
 2. Mask the casualty. 
 
a. Instruct the casualty to mask self if they are able. 
CAUTION: Do not kneel or come into unnecessary contact with the chemically-contaminated 
ground. 
 
b. Position the casualty face up and mask the casualty. Do not fasten the hood at this time. 
 3. Check the casualty's pocket flaps and the area around the casualty for expended 
autoinjectors. 
 4. Administer the antidote. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-459 
NOTE: Atropine is the drug of choice for treating nerve agent poisoning. 
 
a. Mild symptoms. Instruct the casualty to administer one to two MARK I kits or one ATNAA 
depending on the severity of symptoms, followed by observation for several long hours. 
NOTE: ATNAA contains dual chambers, which administer 2. 1mg atropine and 600mg 
Pralidoxime (2-pyridine aldoxime methyl chloride,) or 2-Pam Cl sequentially through one needle. 
 
b. Severe symptoms. Administer three MARK I Kits or ATNAA and one CANA (diazepam) 
auto-injector to the casualty. 
NOTE: Removal of any liquid nerve agent on the skin, on clothing, or in the eyes should be 
accomplished as soon as possible after administration of the antidote. Decontamination should 
be performed by the casualty, if able, or by a buddy. 
 5. Check the casualty for signs of effectiveness of treatment. 
NOTE: The casualty should be observed for at least several hours and not returned to duty. 
Liquid exposures can cause symptoms with onset delayed by many hours. 
 
a. Atropinization. 
 
(1) Heart rate above 90 beats per minute. 
 
(2) Reduced bronchial secretions and bronchial constriction (patient breathes easily 
without excess secretions complicating breathing). 
 
(3) Reduced salivation. 
 
(4) Decreased gastrointestinal motility. 
 
b. Cessation of convulsions. 
 6. Administer additional atropine or CANA, if needed. 
 
a. After the administration of the three Mark I Kits, additional auto-injectors are not 
administered until an hour later. 
 
b. Administer additional atropine (2mg) at approximately 5 minute intervals until 
atropinization is achieved. 
 
c. A total of 15 to 20mg of atropine may be required in the first 3 hours after the onset of 
symptoms to maintain atropinization or until the casualty is evacuated to a medical treatment 
facility (MTF). 
CAUTION: Do not give more than two additional CANA injections for a total of three. 
 
d. Administer a second and, if needed, a third CANA at 5 to 10 minute intervals to 
casualties suffering convulsions. 
NOTE: Additional atropine and the two additional CANA injections can be administered by a 
Combat Lifesaver (CLS), the Soldier Medic or other medical personnel (diazepam is not for selfuse). Ensure all expended auto-injectors are secured to the casualty's left upper pocket of the 
army combat uniform (ACU) or the left pocket on the sleeve of the joint service lightweight 
integrated suit technology (JSLIST) over garment (which has no pockets on the upper torso 
portion of the garment). 
 7. Provide assisted ventilation for severely poisoned casualties, if equipment is available. 
NOTE: The resuscitation device, individual chemical (RDIC) is a hand-powered ventilator 
equipped with a CBRN filter. When the casualty reaches an MTF where oxygen and a positive 
pressure ventilator are available, these should be employed continuously until adequate 
spontaneous respiration is resumed. 
 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

 8. Record the number of injections given and all other treatment provided on the FMC. 
 9. Evacuate the casualty. 
 10. Do not cause further injury to the casualty. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, have another Soldier act as the casualty. Tell the casualty 
not to assist the Soldier in any way. This task must be performed in MOPP4.

Load Casualties Onto a CH-47 Series Helicopter 
081-833-0287 
Conditions: You have completed treating and triaging multiple casualties. You are in charge of 
loading litter and ambulatory patients onto a standard CH-47 helicopter. You will need a CH-47 
helicopter, a medical evacuation litter installation kit, and litters. You are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Load and secure casualties onto the evacuation platform, in the correct sequence, 
without causing further injury. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Follow principles of loading casualties aboard a rotary-wing aircraft. 
NOTE: The CH-47 has a number of possible seating or cargo configurations. In order to prepare 
the CH-47 to carry litter patients, a medical evacuation litter installation kit must be installed. 
The medical evacuation litter installation kit is installed only by the Crew Chief and not the 
medical personnel. This kit consists of 12 litter poles each with 4 litter support brackets attached 
to one litter strap. 
 
a. Responsibility for loading and securing patients on a rotary-wing aircraft. 
 
(1) The pilot in command has the overall responsibility for the proper loading and 
securing of litter and ambulatory casualties and related equipment on board the aircraft. 
 
(2) The final decision regarding how many casualties may be safely loaded rests with the 
pilot in command. 
 
(3) The crew members are responsible for ensuring that the litter squad follows the 
prescribed methods for loading litter or ambulatory casualties and securing litters and related 
medical equipment. 
 
(4) If there is a medic onboard, the medic will determine where each ambulatory and 
litter patient is placed in the aircraft to better facilitate in-flight medical treatment. 
 
b. Safety measures. 
 
(1) Litter bearers must present as low a silhouette as possible when approaching the 
aircraft at all times. 
 
(2) The helicopter must not be approached until a crew member signals to do so. 
 
(3) The litter bearers should approach the aircraft from the rear. 
 
(4) If the helicopter is on a slope and conditions permit, loading personnel should 
approach the aircraft from the downhill side. 
 
(5) Directions given by the crew members must be followed, and litters must be carried 
parallel to the ground. 
 
(6) All patient equipment such as blankets should be secured to the litter to prevent any 
potential damage to the aircraft. 
 
(7) Smoking is not permitted within 50 feet of the aircraft. 
 2. Determine CH-47 rotary wing aircraft load capabilities. 
 
a. The helicopter's maximum capacity is 24 litter patients or 31 ambulatory patients. 
 
b. Combinations of casualty litter /ambulatory capability: 
 
(1) 31 ambulatory / 0 litter. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-477 
 
(2) 25 ambulatory / 4 litter. 
 
(3) 19 ambulatory / 8 litter. 
 
(4) 16 ambulatory / 12 litter. 
 
(5) 10 ambulatory / 16 litter. 
 
(6) 4 ambulatory / 20 litter. 
 
(7) 1 ambulatory / 24 litter. 
 3. Assess the litter casualties to determine the loading sequence. 
 
a. The most seriously injured casualties are loaded last. If it is anticipated that a casualty's 
medical condition may require in-flight emergency medical care (such as cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation), he should be loaded onto the bottom litter support brackets. 
 
b. Casualties in traction splits should be loaded on the bottom litter support brackets. 
 
c. The CH47 should be loaded from the front to the rear with the most critical casualties 
loaded on last so they can be the first to be off loaded at the medical treatment facility. 
 
d. When there are large amounts of litter and ambulatory casualties, the litter casualties 
should be loaded on the same side of the aircraft and the ambulatory casualties on the opposite 
side. 
 4. Prepare the aircraft to receive litter casualties. Pull down the locking handles of all of the 
litter support brackets. 
 5. Direct nonmedical Soldiers to load and secure litter casualties. 
 
a. Have the litter bearer team carry the least critical litter casualties on first towards the front 
of the aircraft. 
 
b. When loading the litter casualties onto a tier (stack of four litters) load from the top of the 
tier to the bottom. 
 
c. Place the litter handles into the litter support brackets. 
 
d. When all four litter handles are in place, reengage the handle clip in the locking bar and 
lock the bracket by moving the locking handle upward. 
 
e. Once all four litter handles are in place, attach the fitting on the bottom of each litter 
support strap to the proper stud on the cargo floor. Press inward on the spring lever, slipping the 
catch over the stud and release the spring lever when it is centered over the proper stud. 
 
f. Tighten the litter support strap by pulling on the free end of the strap until the strap is 
sufficiently tight. 
 
g. Repeat these steps for each litter casualty. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use a CH-47 with air crew and multiple simulated casualties, 
both ambulatory and litter. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier the simulated casualties require being loaded onto the CH-47.

NOTE: Comply with unit standard operating procedure (SOP) and or local environmental 
regulations concerning the cutting of live vegetation, digging holes, and or erosion prevention. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Select a landing site. 
 
a. Determine the size of the landing site. 
NOTE: A helicopter requires a relatively level landing point. Most helicopters cannot go straight 
up or down when fully loaded. Therefore, a larger landing site and better approach and 
departure routes are required. 
 
(1) Select an area at least 30 meters in diameter for a UH-60 series aircraft and 80 
meters in diameter for a CH-47 series aircraft. 
 
(2) Use a 10 to 1 ratio to lay out the landing site, when obstacles are in the approach or 
departure routes. 
NOTE: For example, during the approach and departure, if the helicopter must fly over trees 
that are 15 meters high, the landing site must be at least 150 meters long (10 x 15 = 150 
meters). 
 
b. Select a ground slope that does not exceed 7 degrees. 
NOTE: Helicopters cannot safely land on a slope of more than 15 degrees. When the ground 
slope is under 7 degrees, the helicopter should land up slope. When the ground slope is 7 to 15 
degrees, the pilot is advised and the helicopter must land side slope. 
 
CAUTION: Never land an aircraft downslope, if possible. 
 
c. Determine surface conditions. 
 
(1) Ensure the ground is firm enough that the helicopter does not bog down during 
loading or unloading. 
NOTE: If firm ground cannot be found, issue the pilot an advisory. The pilot can hover at the 
landing site during the loading or unloading. 
 
(2) Avoid areas which may cause loss of visual contact with the ground such as rotor 
wash on dusty, sandy, or snow-covered surfaces. 
CAUTION: Loose debris can cause damage to the blades or engines. 
 
(3) Remove loose debris that can be kicked up by the rotor wash from the landing site. 
 
d. Identify all obstacles within the landing site. 
NOTE: Obstacles are any object that are 18 inches high, wide, or deep. 
 
(1) Remove all obstacles such as stumps, rocks, or holes. 
 
(2) Clearly mark unmovable obstructions and advise the pilot.

3 May 2013 
 2. Establish security for the landing site. 
NOTE: Landing sites should offer some security from enemy observation and direct fire. Good 
landing sites will allow the helicopter to land and depart without exposing it to unneeded risks. 
Security is normally established around the entire landing site. 
 3. Mark the landing site and touchdown point. 
 
a. Use color smoke to give pilot information on the wind direction and speed. 
 
b. Use a signalman. 
CAUTION: Do not use any closer than 50 feet to the touchdown point. 
 
c. Use VS-17 marker panels to mark the landing site. 
 
d. Conduct night operations. 
NOTE: Pilot's NVGs have filtered lenses that do not allow them to see blue or green chemlights. 
 
(1) Mark landing site by an inverted "Y" composed of four lights. 
 
(2) Use strobe lights, or chem-lights, flashlights, or vehicle lights to mark the landing site. 
 
(3) Fully explain the marking system to the pilot when contact is made. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Set up: Provide the Soldier with the equipment and/or materials described in the condition 
statement. 
Brief the Soldier: Tell the Soldier what is expected of him by reviewing the task standards. 
Stress to the Soldier the importance of observing all cautions and warnings to avoid injury to

Unload Casualities From a CH-47 Series Helicopter 
081-833-0295 
Conditions: A CH-47 series helicopter has arrived at your medical treatment facility (MTF) with 
multiple casualties. You are in charge of unloading litter and ambulatory patients from a 
standard CH-47 helicopter. You will need a CH-47 series helicopter that includes a medical 
evacuation litter installation kit, and litters. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Unload the CH-47 series helicopter in the correct sequence without causing further 
injury. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Follow principles of unloading casualties from a rotary-wing aircraft. 
 
a. Responsibility for unloading and securing patients from a rotary-wing aircraft. 
 
(1) The pilot in command has the overall responsibility for the proper unloading of the 
aircraft, as well as, all safety considerations inside and around the aircraft. 
 
(2) The Crew Chief is responsible for ensuring that the litter squad follows the prescribed 
methods for unloading litter and ambulatory casualties and securing litters and related medical 
equipment. 
 
(3) The crew members are responsible for ensuring that the litter squad follows the 
prescribed methods for loading litter or ambulatory casualties and securing litters and related 
medical equipment. 
 
(4) If there is a medic onboard, the medic will determine which casualties are unloaded 
first. 
 
b. Safety measures. 
 
(1) Litter bearers must present as low a silhouette as possible when approaching the 
aircraft at all times. 
 
(2) The helicopter must not be approached until a crew member signals to do so. 
 
(3) The litter bearers should approach the aircraft from the rear. 
 
(4) If the helicopter is on a slope and conditions permit, loading personnel should 
approach the aircraft from the downhill side. 
 
(5) Directions given by the crew members must be followed, and litters must be carried 
parallel to the ground. 
 
(6) All patient equipment such as blankets should be secured to the litter to prevent any 
potential damage to the aircraft. 
 
(7) Smoking is not permitted within 50 feet of the aircraft. 
 2. Direct nonmedical Soldiers to unsecure and unload litter casualties. 
 
a. Have the litter bearer team approach the litters located at the rear of the aircraft first. 
 
b. Each litter tier (stack of four litter casualties) should be unloaded from bottom to the top. 
 
c. Have the litter bearer team unsecure the litter by pulling down on all four of the locking 
handles that was securing one litter to the litter support brackets. 
 
d. Carefully have the litter bearer team move the litter to the center of the aircraft and then 
proceed to carry the litter down the aft ramp and out of the aircraft.

Load Casualties onto Nonstandard Vehicles, 2 1/2 Ton, 6X6 or 5 Ton, 6X6, Cargo Truck 
081-833-0172 
Conditions: You have completed treating and triaging multiple casualties. You are in charge of 
loading litter casualties onto a non-standard transport vehicle. You will need litters, four 
Soldiers, 550 cord or rope and a 2 1/2 ton or 5 ton cargo truck. You are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Load litter casualties without causing further injury. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Determine vehicle load capacities. 
 
a. 12 litters. 
 
b. 16 ambulatory. 
 2. Prepare the vehicle to receive casualties. 
 
a. Remove the canvas cover. (The cover can be rolled toward the front of the truck and 
secured.) 
 
b. Lower the bench seats on both sides of the truck bed. 
 3. Direct nonmedical Soldiers to load the vehicle. 
 
a. Place three litters crosswise on the seats as far forward as possible and three litters 
lengthwise in the bed of the truck as far forward as possible. 
 
b. Secure the litters individually to the seats. 
 
c. Place three additional litters crosswise on the seats and three additional litters lengthwise 
in the bed of the truck. 
 
d. Secure the litters individually to the seats. 
 
e. Raise and secure the tailgate as high as possible to help secure the litters in place. 
NOTE: The casualties with the most serious wounds should be loaded last to ensure that they 
are the first to be unloaded upon arrival at the military treatment facility (MTF). All treatment 
must be performed prior to loading and transport due to no medical care provided while the 
vehicle is en-route. Once the bed of the truck is fully loaded with 12 litters, there is not enough 
room for a medic to provide treatment en-route. 
 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use other Soldiers as litter bearers and simulated casualties. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier the simulated casualties require loading onto nonstandard 
vehicles. The Soldier will perform the task as the leadlitter bearer and instruct the other litter 
bearers on the loading sequence of casualties.

Establish an Ambulance Exchange Point 
081-833-0184 
Conditions: You need to establish an ambulance exchange point (AXP). You will need combat 
service support and operation overlays. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Establish an ambulance exchange point to facilitate evacuation of casualties. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Select the site for an ambulance exchange point (AXP) based on the tactical mission. 
 
a. The location of the AXP will depend on the location and number of units being 
supported. 
 
b. This location should provide the required support to reduce ambulance turnaround time 
to supported units. 
 
c. When supporting tracked vehicles the AXP should be located as close as possible to the 
supported unit to reduce the time and distance requirements for the tracked vehicles. 
 
d. The AXP may be an established point in an ambulance shuttle or it may be designated 
independently. 
 2. Establish the AXP. 
 
a. AXPs may be staffed or unstaffed. 
 
(1) Points that are not staffed may serve as rendezvous points for the rapid transfer of a 
patient from one transportation mode to another. 
 
(2) In most cases AXPs will not be staffed. 
 
(3) The ambulance platoon leader/sergeant coordinates/establishes the AXPs as 
required by the medical evacuation mission. 
 
b. The medical evacuation plan should include an overlay depicting (at a minimum) the 
location of supported units, casualty collection points, Role I facilities, and AXPs. 
 
(1) The platoon leader should also obtain the combat service support and operations 
overlays for the tactical operation. These overlays provide valuable information on: 
 
 
(a) Mine fields. 
 
 
(b) Obstacles and barriers. 
 
 
(c) Artillery target reference points. 
 
 
(d) Air corridors. 
 
(2) Supported units. 
 
 
(a) An AXP may serve two to three battalions/squadrons (brigade support medical 
company/medical troop) or a specific number of non divisional Role I facilities (area support 
medical company). 
 
 
(b) In these cases the AXP should be centrally located to reduce ambulance 
turnaround and enhance the timely execution of the medical evacuation mission. 
Evaluation Preparation: Setup: At the test site, provide all equipment, information, and 
personnel given in the task conditions statement. Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier that they are to 
select and prepare an AXP.

3 May 2013 
 6. Place waterproof pad (chux) under the affected ear. 
 7. Put on gloves. 
CAUTION: Ensure you keep the tip of the dropper pointed downward to prevent medication 
from back flowing into the bulb and potentially contaminating the medication. 
 8. Remove cap from medication container. 
NOTE: If a dropper is to be used, draw up the correct amount of medication. Do not 
contaminate the container cap. 
 9. Straighten patient's external canal with your non-dominant gloved hand. 
 
a. Adult patient pull the auricle of the ear up and back. 
 
b. Infant or child patient pull the auricle down and back. 
 10. Examine the ear canal for drainage using a light source. 
NOTE: If you find any drainage, clean the ear canal before instilling medication as the drainage 
will reduce the medication's effectiveness. 
 11. Support the hand holding the dropper against the patient's head. 
NOTE: Do not allow the dropper or the tip of the bottle to touch the patient's ear. 
 12. Instill the prescribed amount of medication one drop at a time using your dominant hand. 
NOTE: Do not squeeze the bulb of the dropper too hard. 
 
a. Direct the flow of medication toward the sides of the ear canal. 
 
b. Hold the ear canal into position until you see the medication disappear down the canal. 
 13. Release the external canal gently. 
NOTE: If ordered, place a cotton ball loosely into the opening of the patient's ear canal to 
prevent the medication from leaking out. Ensure that you don't place the cotton ball too deeply 
as this may prevent drainage of secretions and increase pressure on the eardrum. 
 14. Replace the cap (or dropper) on the medication bottle. 
 15. Clean and dry outer ear. 
 16. Instruct patient to remain on their side for 5 to 10 minutes. 
NOTE: This will allow the medication time to absorb.

Apply Restraining Devices to Patients 
081-833-0076 
WARNING: Restraints can cause numerous problems, including limited mobility, skin 
breakdown, impaired circulation, incontinence, psychological distress, and strangulation. Do not 
restrain a patient in the prone position. This position limits their field of vision, intensifies feelings 
of helplessness and impairs respiration, especially if the patient has been sedated. 
Conditions: You have a patient that needs to be restrained. You will need a bed, restraints 
(limb, vest, or mitt, as needed), padding if needed, restraint flow sheet DA Form 4700 Medical 
Record-Supplemental Medical Data, flexible gauze (Kerlix/Kling), cravats, pen, SF 510 Nursing 
Notes, bed alarm if bed has one, minimum of three coworkers, and sheets. You are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Apply restraining devices to a patient without causing injury to the patient or 
yourself. 
NOTE: Restraint is a method of physically restricting a person’s freedom of movement, physical 
activity, or normal access to their body. This includes not only traditional restraints, such as limb 
restraints, but also tightly tucked sheets or the use of side rails to prevent a patient from getting 
out of bed. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Assess and verify the need for restraint usage. 
 
a. Follow the Joint Commission (TJC) and central material service (CMS) standards for 
applying restraints. 
 
b. Make sure that less-restrictive measures have been tried before applying restraints. 
 2. Obtain a written or verbal order from a medical officer for the restraints. 
 3. Tell the patient what you are about to do, and describe the restraints to them. 
NOTE: Assure them that they’re being used to protect them from injury, not to punish them. 
 4. Obtain adequate assistance if necessary to restrain the patient before entering their room. 
 
a. Enlist the aid of several coworkers. 
 
b. Organize their effort. 
 
c. Give each person a specific task. 
WARNING: Never secure restraints to the side rails because someone might inadvertently 
lower the rail before noticing the attached restraint. This may jerk the patient's limb or body, 
causing them discomfort and trauma. 
CAUTION: Never secure all four restraints to one side of the bed because the patient may fall 
out of bed. 
 5. Apply restraining device to patient. 
NOTE: Do not apply a limb restraint above an intravenous (IV) site because the constriction 
may occlude the infusion or cause infiltration into surrounding tissue. 
 
a. Limb restraint. 
 
(1) Wrap the patient’s wrist or ankle with a padded restraint. 
 
(2) Pass the strap on the narrow end of the restraint through the slot in the broad end, 
and adjust for snug fit. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-510 
 
3 May 2013 
 
(3) Alternatively, fasten the buckle or Velcro cuffs to fit the restraint. 
 
(4) You should be able to slip one or two fingers between the restraint and the patient’s 
skin. 
 
(5) Avoid applying the restraint too tightly because it may impair circulation distal to the 
restraint. 
 
(6) Tie all restraints securely to the frame of the bed, chair, or wheelchair and out of the 
patient’s reach. 
WARNING: Never secure the restraint to a bedrail or other movable part of the equipment. 
 
(7) Use a bow or knot that can be released quickly and easily in an emergency. 
NOTE: Never tie a regular knot to secure the straps. 
 
(8) Leave 1 inch to 2 inches (2. 5 to 5 cm) of slack in the straps to allow room for 
movement. 
 
(9) After application, be alert for signs of impaired circulation, movement, or sensation in 
the extremity distal to the restraint. 
NOTE: Check skin color, condition, temperature and check pulse. If the restraints are too tight 
or the patient is complaining of numbness and tingling, loosen the restraints. 
 
(10) Release the restraints every 2 hours to assess the skin and perform range of motion 
(ROM) exercises to stimulate circulation and prevent contractures and loss of mobility. 
 
b. Vest restraint. 
 
(1) Assist the patient to a sitting position if their condition permits. 
 
(2) Slip the vest over their gown. 
 
(3) Crisscross the cloth flaps at the front, placing the V-shaped opening at the patient’s 
throat. 
WARNING: Never crisscross the flaps in the back because this may cause the patient to choke 
if they try to squirm out of the vest. 
 
(4) Pass the tab on one flap through the slot on the opposite flap. 
 
(5) Adjust the vest for the patient’s comfort. 
 
(6) You should be able to slip your fist between the vest and the patient. 
CAUTION: Avoid wrapping the vest too tightly because it may restrict respiration. 
 
(7) Tie the restraint. 
 
(8) After applying the vest, check the patient’s respiratory rate and breath sounds 
regularly. 
 
(9) Be alert for signs of respiratory distress. 
 
(10) Make sure the vest has not tightened with the patient’s movement. 
 
(11) Loosen the vest frequently, if possible, so the patient can stretch, turn, and breathe 
deeply. 
 
c. Mitt restraint. 
 
(1) Wash and dry the patient’s hands. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-511 
 
(2) Roll up a washcloth or gauze pad, and place it in the patient’s palm. 
 
(3) Have the patient form a loose fist, if possible; then pull the mitt over it and secure the 
closure. 
 
(4) To restrict the patient’s arm movement, attach the strap to the mitt and tie it securely, 
using a bow or a knot that can be released quickly and easily in an emergency. 
WARNING: When using mitts made of transparent mesh, check hand movement and skin color 
frequently to assess circulation. 
 
(5) Remove the mitts regularly to stimulate circulation, and perform passive ROM 
exercises to prevent contractures. 
 6. Inform the medical officer within 12 hours of placing the patient in restraints. 
NOTE: The patient must be examined by the medical officer within 24 hours of the initiation of 
restraints. 
 7. Evaluate and assist the restrained patient IAW local facility policies. 
 
a. If patient is at high risk of aspiration, ensure they are restrained on their side. 
 
b. The restrained patient has limited mobility, therefore their nutrition, elimination and 
positioning becomes your responsibility. 
 
c. Assess and monitor the condition of the restrained patient continually. 
NOTE: Ensure skin color, condition, temperature and pulse are monitored continually. 
Loosen restraints per local standard operating procedures and perform range of motion 
exercises to keep patient's circulation in tact and to avoid permanent injury. 
 8. Document the procedure on the DA Form 4700 and SF 510. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use another Soldier to simulate a patient requiring restraints. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier the simulated patient requires restraints to be applied. Use other 
Soldiers to assist you with this task.

Skill Level SL3 
Subject Area 20: Medical Treatment 
Perform a Digital Block Anesthesia 
081-833-0036 
Conditions: You have a patient who needs an anesthetic digital block. You will need 2% 
lidocaine solution without epinephrine, 3 to 5 ml syringe, 18 gauge needle, 23 gauge needle, 
alcohol pad and gauze pad, draping, sterile gloves and SF 600 (Medical Record - Chronological 
Record of Medical Care). You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform an anesthetic digital block without causing injury to patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Solicit a patient history. 
 2. Gather equipment. 
NOTE: Local anesthetics are to be used without epinephrine in the digits to avoid 
vasoconstriction of adjacent arteries, which may lead to ischemia or infarction of local tissues. 
 3. Perform a patient care handwash. 
 4. Prepare an injection for administration. (See task 081-833-0088.) 
NOTE: Prepare the injection by drawing up 3 milliliters of 2% lidocaine from the vial. 
 5. Put on gloves. 
 6. Prepare the site. 
 
a. Position the patient with the effected digit easily accessible. 
 
b. Clean the injection site at the base of the digit just above the bottom knuckle on both 
sides of the digit with an alcohol pad or antimicrobial solution. 
NOTE: Do not touch the injection site after cleansing. 
 7. Perform the digital block anesthesia. 
 
a. Insert the needle perpendicularly into the web space, at the base of the finger, just distal 
to the metacarpal-phalangeal joint. 
NOTE: Be careful not to push the needle out of the bottom of the finger or through the volar 
aspect of the web space. 
 
b. Advance the needle into the layer of fat under the skin. This can easily be determined by 
the "give" you will feel when you have penetrated the skin. 
 
c. Inject about one milliliter of lidocaine into the fatty layer under the skin while withdrawing 
the needle back to the skin surface (the nerve you are numbing runs through this space and 
must be surrounded by lidocaine to prevent the transmission of nerve signals). 
 
d. Allow 10-20 minutes for the anesthetic to take effect. 
 
e. Repeat the procedure on the opposite side of the digit. Wait about five minutes and 
check the digit for sensation, (Pressure is a normal sensation but if any pain is felt, the process 
can be repeated with another milliliter of lidocaine on each side of the digit). 
 
f. All digits except the great toe can be effectively anesthetized in the same manner. The 
three-sided digital block technique is most effective on the great toe. 
 
(1) Place the patient's extremity plantar side down. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-514 
 
3 May 2013 
 
(2) Insert the needle at a 90-degree angle at the medial aspect of the digit, just distal to 
the metataral-phalangeal joint. 
 
(3) Slowly inject the anesthetic as the needle is advanced toward the plantar side, 
without piercing the volar skin. 
 
(4) Slowly withdraw the needle and redirect it medially. 
 
(5) Advance the needle slowly from medial to lateral side while the anesthetic is injected. 
 
(6) Withdraw the needle. 
 
(7) Make another injection over the already anesthetized skin at the lateral aspect of the 
digit, with the needle at 90 degrees, advancing it from the dorsal to ventral aspect, as was done 
medially. 
 8. Remove gloves. 
 9. Document the procedure on SF 600. 
 
a. Consent. 
 
b. Description of the area of interest prior to performing the procedure. 
 
c. Give a description of the procedure; to include the type and quanity of anesthesia used. 
 
d. How the patient tolerated the procedure. 
 
e. Any follow-up care or instructions given to the patient. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
This task is best evaluated by verbalization and demonstration of the steps. Give the Soldier a

Conditions: You need to establish a sterile field. You will need sterile packs, sterile drapes and 
towels, a small solution basin, sterile liquids, sterile needles and syringes, sterile gloves, and a 
flat, clean, dry surface. You have performed a patient care handwash. You are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Establish a sterile field without violating aseptic technique. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Obtain sterile equipment and supplies IAW local SOP. 
 2. Select a flat, clean, dry surface. 
NOTE: Choose a surface away from drafts, if possible. 
 3. Create a sterile field with a double-wrapped sterile package. 
 
a. Lift the top flap of the sterile pack away from the body without crossing your hand or arm 
over the sterile field. 
 
b. Lift the remaining flaps, one at a time, away from the center without crossing your hand 
or arm over the sterile field. 
 4. Introduce sterile items onto the sterile field. 
NOTE: The outer two inch border of the sterile field is considered contaminated. Items that fall 
into that area are considered contaminated and should not be used. If an item rolls from the two 
inch border onto the sterile field, the sterile field is considered contaminated and the procedure 
must be stopped immediately and the procedure must be repeated using a new sterile pack. 
 
a. Commercially prepacked items (syringes, sutures, needles, etc.). 
 
(1) Keeping your hands on the outside of the sterile wrapper, grasp the opening edge of 
the package. 
 
(2) Carefully fold (roll) each end of the wrapper back toward your wrists. 
 
(3) Without contaminating the contents, drop them onto the sterile field. 
NOTE: If the wrapper has been punctured, torn, or has water marks, the item is no longer 
sterile. 
 
b. Centralized materiel service (CMS) items (wrapped in double muslin wrappers). 
 
(1) Remove the outer wrapper. 
 
(2) Grasp the edge of the item being unwrapped, keeping your hand on the outside of 
the inner wrapper. 
 
(3) Fold each edge of the wrapper slowly back over your wrist of the hand holding the 
item. 
 
(4) Drop the item onto the sterile field. 
 5. Open sterile liquids. 
NOTE: 1. Liquids prepared in CMS are considered sterile if a vacuum release sound is heard 
when the bottle is opened. If there is no sound, the bottle is considered unsterile, and a new 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-518 
 
3 May 2013 
bottle must be obtained before continuing the procedure. 2. Some commercially prepared 
bottles of sterile solution may not make a vacuum release sound. 
 
a. Remove the outer protective bottle seal, if necessary, and remove the cap. 
 
b. Hold the cap in one hand, or place the cap so the top rests on the table. 
NOTE: The bottle rim and inside of the cap are considered sterile. 
CAUTIONS: Discard the sterile solution under any of the following conditions: 1. Anyone 
touches the bottle rim. 2. The lip of the bottle touches non-sterile items. 3. Someone touches the 
inside of the cap or the part of the cap that touches the container is placed on the table. 
 6. Pour sterile liquids. 
 
a. Hold the bottle with the label against your palm. 
 
b. Pour a small amount of the liquid from the bottle into a waste receptacle. 
 
c. Hold the bottle about 6 inches above the container into which the liquid is to be poured. 
 
d. Slowly pour a steady stream to avoid splashing, thus preventing contamination. 
 
e. Replace the cap without contaminating the bottle. 
 
f. Write the date and time the bottle was opened and your initials on the label. Return the 
bottle to the storage area or discard it IAW local SOP. 
NOTE: If the sterile field is contaminated at any time, the procedure must be stopped 
immediately. Repeat all steps using new sterile equipment. 
7. Do not violate aseptic technique. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: Place all necessary materials and equipment including sterile packs, sterile drapes and 
towels, a small solution basin, sterile liquids, sterile needles and syringes, and sterile gloves on 
a table. Place another table adjacent to the first table for the sterile field. Have a waste 
receptacle in place to receive the sterile liquid poured.

Perform Abscess Incision and Drainage 
081-833-0192 
Conditions: You have a patient with an abscess that needs incision and drainage (I&D). You 
will need povidone-iodine (1% betadine) antimicrobial solution, 10ml syringe, 25 gauge needle, 
1/2 inch plain or iodoform sterile gauze packing, 4 x 4 inch sterile gauze sponge, adhesive tape, 
No. 11 or No. 15 scalpel blade with handle, hemostat (curved), tissue forceps, surgical scissors, 
cotton-tipped sterile applicators, gloves, a culture swab, draping, lidocaine and SF 600 (Medical 
Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care) and a patient consent form. You are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Perform an abscess I&D without causing further injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Solicit a patient history to assess if the abscess requires urgent attention (abscesses found 
on the extremeties, buttocks, breast, perianal area, or those that occur from infected hair 
follicles). 
NOTE: Smaller (<5mm in diameter) abscesses may resolve with conservative measures (warm 
soaks) to promote drainage. Larger abscesses will require incision to drain them. As the 
increased inflammation, pus collection and walling off of the abscess cavity diminishes, so does 
the effectiveness of conservative measures. 
 2. Gather equipment. 
 3. Perform a patient care handwash. (See task 081-831-0007.) 
 4. Put on sterile gloves. (See task 081-831-0008.) 
 5. Prepare the site. 
 
a. Position the patient with the abscess easily accessible. 
 
b. Prepare the abscess and surrounding area with the antimicrobial solution. 
 
c. Apply sterile drapes to completely surround the abscess and to cover all unprepared 
areas adjacent to the abscess. 
 
d. Perform a field block by anesthetizing the perimeter surrounding the abscess with 1%2% lidocaine with epinephrine. 
NOTE: Do not inject the anesthetic directly into the abscess because it will not be effective in 
the acidic medium. 
 
e. Hold the syringe parallel to the skin and insert a 25-gauge needle into the middle of the 
dome of the abscess so the needle is just slightly under the skin (the anesthetic will spread 
within the subcutaneous plane of the entire abscess). 
 
f. Wait 2-3 minutes for the anesthetic to take effect. 
 6. Perform the incision, drainage, and packing of abscess. 
 
a. Using the No. 11 or No. 15 blade, incise the abscess deeply from one side of the 
fluctuant area, to the opposite side of the fluctuant area. This is necessary to ensure complete 
evacuation of the purulent drainage. 
 
b. Allow the material to drain, using the 4 x 4 gauze sponges to soak up any purulence and 
blood. Use the sterile cotton-tipped applicator to swab the inside of the abscess cavity for 
culture. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-522 
 
3 May 2013 
 
c. Use the hemostat, wrapped with gauze, to gently explore the abscess cavity and to 
break up any sacs or adhesions within the abscess. 
NOTE: Do not use a gloved finger to break up loculations in an abscess that may contain a 
sharp or jagged foreign body. 
 
d. Clean the cavity with 4-6 sterile cotton-tipped applicators soaked with 3% hydrogen 
peroxide. You may also irrigate the cavity with 0. 9% normal saline solution under moderate 
pressure. 
 
e. Loosely pack the abscess with 1/4 to 1 inch iodoform or plain sterile gauze packing 
allowing a small portion of the packing to protrude outside the cavity and dress the incision site 
with sterile gauze. 
 7. Remove gloves. 
 8. Document the procedure on SF 600. 
 
a. Consent. 
 
b. Description of the abscess prior to performing the procedure. 
 
c. Give a description of the procedure (type and quanity of anesthesia used, length of 
incision, approximate amount of material exuded and culture if made). 
 
d. Type of packing and dressing material. 
 
e. How the patient tolerated the procedure. 
 
f. Any follow-up care or instructions given to the patient. 
 
(1) Stress the importance of keeping the area dry for the first 24 hours. Have the patient 
leave the packing in place and the initial dressing should not be disturbed until the following day. 
Elevate the affected extremity when possible. 
 
(2) On the second day, the patient should remove the outside dressing, leaving the 
packing undisturbed and apply warm water compresses or submerge the site in a warm water 
bath for 20-30 minutes. This will hasten resolution of the inflammatory process and promote 
rapid healing. 
 
(3) The patient should return as soon as possible if he develops a fever, if the area of 
erythema increases in size or if flu-like symptoms develop. 
 
(4) The patient may require medications for pain (rarely) and possibly antibiotics. 
 9. Re-evaluate the patient in 24-72 hours after the I&D procedure. 
NOTE: Most lesions are reevaluated 48 hours after the procedure; with the first packing change 
occurring at this time, if drainage is present, (facial abscesses should be reevaluated within 24 
hours, after which, warm soaks should be started). Small abscesses can be cleaned with a 
cotton swab swirled in the cavity that is left open. 
 
a. Perform a patient care handwash. 
 
b. Put on gloves. 
 
c. Remove the external dressing. 
 
d. Gently remove the packing material from the abscess site. 
 
e. Cleanse the abscess site with a sterile cotton-tipped applicator soaked in hydrogen 
peroxide 3%. 
NOTE: Anesthesia is rarely necessary. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-523 
 
f. Do not repack the cavity, especially if it is clean and pain and tenderness are significantly 
diminished. 
 
g. Re-apply a sterile dressing to the open abscess site. 
 
h. Remove gloves. 
 
i. Document your findings and any follow-on care plan on SF 600. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
This task is best evaluated by verbalization and demonstration of the steps. Give the Soldier a 
scenario in which he must perform an I&D of an abscess.

Subject Area 21: Trauma Treatment 
Suture a Laceration 
081-833-0071 
Conditions: You have a casualty with a minor laceration requiring closure. The laceration does 
not involve the face, hands, feet, or genitalia. You will need sterile suture set, appropriate type 
and size of suture, staples, skin adhesive, steri strips, lidocaine 1% with and without 
epinephrine, saline irrigation solution, antiseptic solution, sterile gloves, antibiotic ointment, 
sterile dressing, and SF 600 (Medical Record-Chronological Record of Medical Care). You are 
not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Properly clean, anesthetize, and suture the laceration without causing further harm. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Prepare the site. (See task 081-833-0087.) 
 2. Anesthetize the area. (See task 081-833-0090.) 
 3. Select the method of closure. 
 
a. Skin adhesive. 
 
(1) Hold the wound edges together and slightly everted with tissue forceps. 
 
(2) Apply adhesive with the applicator tip by lightly wiping along the long axis of the 
wound. 
NOTE: Three to four thin layers should be applied successively. Avoid droplets or a single thick 
layer. 
 
(3) Hold the wound edges together for approximately 1 minute. 
 
(4) Instruct the casualty not to apply ointment or dressing to the wound. 
 
b. Steri strips. 
 
(1) Apply benzoin to a 2 to 3 cm area beyond the wound edges. Do not allow benzoin to 
enter the wound. 
 
(2) Using forceps, attach the strip to the skin on one side and then pull the steri strip 
across the wound to close the wound edges. 
 
(3) Start in the center and progress toward each end. Leave some space between 
individual strips. 
 
(4) Instruct the casualty not to get the area wet. 
 
c. Staples. 
 
(1) Hold the wound edges together with tissue forceps. 
 
(2) Place the stapling device gently against the skin surface. 
 
(3) Slowly squeeze the trigger. 
 
(4) Evenly place only the necessary amount of staples to close the wound. 
NOTE: There is little to no benefit to locally infiltrating an area for one to two staples to be 
placed. The anesthetic is more discomforting than the procedure. 
 
d. Suture. 
 
(1) Select the proper size and type of material. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-525 
 
(2) Check for adequate anesthesia by grasping the wound edges with tissue forceps. 
Note if the casualty can feel pain. 
 
(3) Grasp the needle with the needle holder about 1/2 to 1/3 the distance from where the 
suture is attached. 
 
(4) Hold the needle holder in the palm, using the index finger for fine control. 
 
(5) Enter the skin at approximately a 90 degree angle on the far side of the wound and 
exit on the near side. 
NOTE: You should enter and exit the skin about 2 mm from the edge. Entry and exit points 
should be directly across from each other. 
 
(6) Pull the suture through the wound until approximately a 2 cm tail remains on the far 
side of wound. 
 
(7) Hold the end of the suture attached to the needle in the non-dominant hand. 
 
(8) Hold the needle holder in the dominant hand. 
 
(9) Loop the suture twice around the needle holder. 
 
(10) Grasp the free end of the suture with the blades of the needle holder. 
 
(11) Cross the hands so that the hand holding the swaged end is on the far side and the 
hand holding the needle holder and free end are on the near side of the wound. 
 
(12) Pull upward on the suture ends when clinching the first throw. 
 
(13) Adjust the tension of the first throw so that the wound edges come together snugly 
but not tightly. 
 
(14) For the second throw of the knot, the needle end is on the far side of the wound and 
the free end on the near side. 
 
(15) Hold the needle end of the suture in the non-dominant hand and lay the needle 
holder on top. 
 
(16) Loop the suture only once around the needle holder. 
 
(17) Grasp the free ends with the blades of the holder. 
 
(18) Cross the hands so that the sutures smoothly intertwine. 
CAUTION: Take care not to cinch down too tightly on the second throw because the tightness 
will be transmitted to the wound. 
 
(19) Cinch down the throw. 
 
(20) Pull the knot to the side so that it will not directly overlie the laceration. 
 
(21) The pattern of looping the suture around the holder on alternate sides of the wound 
is repeated until the desired number of throws are completed. 
 
(22) Cut the ends of the suture material to approximately 3 to 5 cm length. 
 4. Apply antibiotic ointment to the site. 
 5. Apply a sterile dressing to the site. 
 6. Remove gloves. 
 7. Document the procedure on SF 600.

Apply Local Anesthesia 
081-833-0090 
Conditions: You have a patient requiring local anesthesia. You will need the ordered 
anesthetic, sterile needle and syringe, patient’s chart, pen, and sterile gloves. You are not in a 
CBRN environment. 
Standards: Apply local anesthesia without causing injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Prepare the site. (See task 081-833-0087.) 
 2. Anesthetize the area. 
 
a. Cryoanesthesia. 
 
(1) Apply a moistened ice cube to the skin for about 5 minutes. 
 
(2) Spray the area with commercial refrigerants, as directed. 
 
b. Topical applications. 
 
(1) Apply the agent directly to the mucus membrane, serous surface, or onto the open 
wound. 
 
(2) Slightly saturate a gauze with the appropriate agent and place it on the wound for 5 
to 10 minutes. 
 
(3) Check the area for tissue blanching which indicates adequate anesthesia. 
NOTE: Often topical application is suboptimal for suture replacement. 
 
c. Simple infiltration. 
 
(1) Ensure the casualty does not have an allergy to the agent. 
 
(2) Using a needle and syringe, draw up an adequate amount of 1% lidocaine. 
WARNING: Lidocaine with epinephrine is never used on the tip of the nose, ears, fingers, toes 
or genitalia due to vasoconstriction. 
 
(3) The anesthetic solution is injected near the wound edge extending approximately 1 
cm around the wound margin. 
 
(4) Aspirate prior to injecting the solution to ensure the needle is not in a vessel. (If blood 
returns into the syringe, withdraw, change the needle, and try a new site. 
 
(5) Slowly inject solution beneath the skin surface, raising a wheal in the area to be 
anesthetized. 
 
(6) Repeat steps 2c(3) through 2c( 5) depending on the size of the laceration. 
 3. Document the procedure on SF 510. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: For training and evaluation, use a simulation device capable of having anesthesia 
administered and sutures placed. 
Brief Soldier: Tell the Soldier the simulated patient has a laceration that requires local 
anesthesia to be administered.

 1. Explain the procedure to casualty if the casualty is conscious. 
 2. Record baseline vital signs and respiratory assessment. 
 3. Prepare the casualty. 
 
a. Position the casualty appropriately. 
 
b. Raise the arm on the affected side above the casualty's head. 
 
c. Select the insertion site at the anterior axillary line over the 4th or 5th intercostal space. 
NOTE: Identify safe triangle and insertion site, 5th intercostal space in the midaxillary line. The 
point of insertion in the chest most commonly occurs on the side (lateral thorax), at a line drawn 
from the armpit (anterior axillary line) to the side (lateral) of the nipple in males, or to the side 
(about 2 to 5 cm) above the sternoxiphoid junction (lower junction of the sternum, or chest bone) 
in females. 
 
d. Cleanse the site with antiseptic solution. 
 
e. Put on sterile gloves. 
 
f. Drape the area. 
 
g. Liberally infiltrate the area with the 1% lidocaine solution. 
NOTE: Keep the total amount of Lidocaine used below 0. 5 mL/kg (milliters/kilogram), (5 
milligrams/kilograms). 
 
h. Make an incision into the skin that is parallel to the rib. 
NOTE: Incision should be 2 to 3 centimeters (cm) transverse incision over the selected site and 
extend it down to the intercostal muscles and 1 to 2 cm below the interspace through which the 
tube will be placed. 
 4. Insert the tube. 
 
a. Insert the Kelly forceps through the intercostal muscles in the next intercostal space. 
CAUTION: Avoid puncturing the lung. Always use the superior margin of the rib to avoid the 
intercostal nerves and vessels. 
 
b. Puncture the parietal pleura with the tip of the forceps and slightly enlarge the hole by 
opening the clamp 1. 5 to 2 cm. 
 
c. Immediately insert a gloved finger into the pleural cavity to clear any adhesions, clots, 
etc.

d. Grasp the tip of the chest tube with Kelly forceps. Insert the tip of the tube in the incision 
as you withdraw your finger. 
 
e. Advance the tube until the last side hole is 2. 5 to 5 cm inside the chest wall. 
NOTE: Advance insertion of tube until the pleural cavity is reached. Drain insertion and 
positioning (aim apically for the pneumothorax or basally for hemothorax (fluid)). 
 
f. Connect the end of the tube to a one-way drainage valve (e.g., Heimlich valve). 
 
g. Secure the tube using the suture materials. 
 
h. Apply an occulusive dressing. 
NOTE: Open the packages containing the petroleum gauze, 4 x 4 drain dressings, and gauze 
pads, then place the petroleum gauze and two 4 x 4 drain dressings around the insertion site, 
one from the top and the other from the bottom. Place several 4 x 4 gauze pads on top of the 
drain dressings. Tape the dressings, covering them completely to form an occlusive dressing. 
 
i. Check the status of the drainage tubing. 
 
j. Radiograph the chest to confirm placement, if available. 
 5. Reassess the casualty. 
 
a. Check for bilateral breath sounds.

Insert an Endotracheal Tube 
081-833-0100 
Conditions: You have an unconscious, non-breathing casualty with no gag reflex in a field 
environment. You will need an assistant, batteries (appropriate for laryngoscope size), 
laryngoscope with blades (straight and curved, sizes 1-4), extra light bulb for laryngoscope 
blade, endotracheal tube (7 mm), bag-valve-mask, nonsterile gloves, suction equipment, pulse 
oximeter, 10 cc syringe, 1/2 inch adhesive tape, scissors, stethoscope and a DD Form 1380 US 
Field Medical Card (FMC) or DA Form 7656 Tactical Combat Casualty Care Card (TCCC). You 
are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Insert an endotracheal (ET) tube in the airway and verify tube placement by 
checking for bilateral breath sounds. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Put on gloves. 
 2. Open the airway manually. 
 3. Elevate the tongue, insert simple airway adjunct (either orophyrngeal airway (OPA) or 
nasophyrngeal airway (NPA)). 
 4. Ventilate casualty with a bag-valve-mask device. 
 5. Attach oxygen reservoir to bag-valve-mask device and connect to high-flow regulator (1215 lpm if available. 
 6. Ventilate casualty at a rate of 10-12/minute. 
 7. Direct assistant to pre-oxygenate casualty. 
 8. Inspect and prepare equipment for intubation, (laryngoscope, ET tube, stylet). 
 
a. Attach the laryngoscope blade to the laryngoscope. 
 
(1) Hook the blade to the connector on the top of the laryngoscope. 
 
(2) Lift the blade at a 90 degree angle to lock the blade in place. 
 
b. Select the appropriate size of ET tube for the casualty (average adult male-8. 0-8. 5 cm; 
average adult female - 7. 0-7. 5 cm). 
 
c. Fill the 10 cubic centimeter (cc) syringe with air and attach the syringe to the ET tube cuff 
valve (pilot balloon), inflate the cuff, and inspect for leaks. 
NOTE: If you detect a leak, discard ET tube in trash container and get a new one. 
 
d. Deflate cuff by pulling back on the plunger until all the air is out. 
 
e. Insert stylet into ET tube. 
 
(1) The stylet should be inserted into the ET tube so the tip of the stylet is recessed ½ 
inch from the tip of the ET tube. 
 
(2) Bend the other end of the stylet at a 90 degree angle to prevent it from going further 
into the ET tube. 
NOTE: Attempt to maintain oxygen saturation at 100%. This can be monitored through a pulse 
oximeter. 
 9. Position the casualty’s head by hyperextending the neck. 
NOTE: This will allow for visualization of the vocal cords. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG

3-535 
 10. Open the casualty’s mouth and hold it open by pushing down on the jaw. Remove the 
airway adjunct. 
 11. Insert the laryngoscope blade into mouth and visualize vocal cords. 
 
a. Stand or kneel at the top of the casualty’s head. 
 
b. Hold the laryngoscope with your left hand. 
 
c. Open and lock the blade at a 90 degree angle. 
 
d. Place the blade into the right side of the casualty’s mouth. 
 
e. Move the laryngoscope to the center of the mouth by sliding the laryngoscope to the left 
side of the mouth; this will in turn move the patient's tongue out of the way. 
 
f. Advance the blade a short distance to observe the epiglottis. 
 
g. Retract the epiglottis and observe the vocal cords. 
 
(1) If using a Macintosh blade (curved), apply anterior pressure to the vallecula with the 
tip of the laryngoscope blade. This will fold back the epiglottis and expose the vocal cords. 
 
(2) If using a Miller blade (straight), hook the blade tip under the epiglottis and pull up to 
fold back the epiglottis and expose the vocal cords. 
 12. Insert the ET tube into the trachea. 
 
a. Grasp the ET tube with your right hand. 
 
b. Carefully guide the tip of the tube between the vocal cords until the cuff is just below the 
level of the vocal cords. 
 13. Remove the laryngoscope from the airway. 
 14. Remove the stylet from the ET tube. 
 15. Inflate the cuff of the ET tube by injecting the required amount of air (5 to 10 cc) to create 
seal by pressing the plunger of the syringe. 
 16. Check placement of the ET tube. 
 
a. Instruct assistant to auscultate the casualty’s lung fields and epigastric area while you 
manually ventilate the casualty. 
 
b. If casualty has strong bilateral breath sounds and no sounds of air movement are heard 
over the epigastric area, proceed to step 17. 
 
c. If sound is heard over one lung field only, you must partially deflate the cuff, withdraw the 
ET tube slightly, reinflate the cuff, and listen again. 
 
d. If a rushing sound is heard over the epigastric area, and breath sounds are not heard, 
deflate the cuff, withdraw the ET tube completely, reoxygenate the casualty, and repeat 
procedure. 
 17. Secure the ET tube with 1/2 inch adhesive tape. 
 18. Manually ventilate casualty. 
 19. Discard trash and gloves in trash can. 
 20. Perform a patient care hand wash. 
 21. Record procedure on FMC or TCCC Card.

Subject Area 23: Venipuncture and IV Therapy 
Administer Blood 
081-835-3000 
Conditions: You have verified a medical officer's order requiring the administration of blood. 
You have identified the patient and explained the procedure. A patient care handwash has been 
performed. You will need a blood pack with SF 518 (Medical Record - Blood or Blood 
Component Transfusion), thermometer, blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, blood transfusion 
recipient set ("Y" type), intravenous (IV) stand, tourniquet, needle and syringe, IV catheter, tape, 
alcohol and betadine prep pads, gloves, a container of 0. 9% normal saline for injection, and the 
patient's clinical records. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Administer the blood lAW the medical officer's orders and without causing injury to 
the patient. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Verify and inspect the blood pack received from the laboratory. 
 
a. Note the time the blood pack was received and record the time on the SF 518. 
NOTE: Infusion of a blood pack should be initiated within 30 minutes of being issued. 
 
b. Two people must verify and match the information on the blood pack label with the data 
on the requisition form (SF 518). 
NOTE: One of the verifiers must be a Registered Nurse when directed by local policy. 
 
c. Inspect the blood for abnormalities such as gas bubbles or black or gray colored 
sediment (indicative of bacterial growth). 
NOTE: Return the blood pack to the blood bank if any abnormality is present or suspected. 
 
d. Match the blood pack with the patient's identification. 
 
(1) The same two people must compare the information on the blood unit with the data 
on the patient's wristband. Ensure the patient's name, blood type, and hospital number 
positively match the data on the blood pack. 
 
(2) Sign the SF 518 lAW local policy when all the data has been confirmed as a positive 
match. 
 2. Establish baseline data. 
 
a. Reconfirm data from the patient's history regarding allergies or previous reactions to 
blood or blood products. 
 
b. Measure and evaluate the vital signs. 
 
c. Record the vital signs on the SF 518 and in the nursing notes. 
 3. Prepare the blood and the blood recipient set. 
NOTE: Use only tubing that is designed for the administration of blood products. It is equipped 
with a filter designed for the fine filtration required for blood products. 
 
a. Close all three clamps on the "Y" tubing. 
 
b. Aseptically insert one of the tubing spikes into the container of normal saline. Invert and 
hang this container about 3 feet above the level of the patient. 
 
c. Open the clamp on the normal saline line and prime the upper line and the blood filter. 
 
d. Open the clamp on the empty line on which you will eventually hang the blood. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-538 
 
3 May 2013 
Normal saline will flow up the empty line to prime that portion of the tubing. 
NOTE: Use only 0. 9% normal saline for injection with blood. Other solutions are not compatible. 
 
e. Once the blood line is primed with saline, close the clamp on the blood line. 
 
f. Leave the clamp on the normal saline line open. 
 
g. Open the main roller clamp to prime the lower infusion tubing. 
 
h. Close the main roller clamp. 
 
i. Aseptically expose the blood port on the blood pack. 
 
j. Aseptically insert the remaining spike into the blood port and hang the blood at the same 
level as the normal saline container. 
NOTE: If Y type recipient tubing is not available, use regular infusion tubing for the normal 
saline and the available blood recipient tubing for the blood pack. Prime each set. Attach a 
sterile, large bore (16 or 18 gauge) needle to the end of the blood tubing and piggyback the 
blood into the normal saline line below the level of the roller clamp. Hang the blood pack at least 
6 inches higher than the normal saline. 
 4. Perform the venipuncture. (See task 081-833-0033.) 
NOTE: Insert a large gauge IV catheter (14, 16, or 18) for administering blood to an adult 
patient. This will enhance the flow of blood and prevent hemolysis of the cells. 
 5. Begin the infusion of blood. 
 
a. Attach the primed infusion set to the catheter, tape it securely, and open the main roller 
clamp. 
NOTE: If a preexisting catheter is being used, run in 50 cc of normal saline to flush out any 
incompatible solution. If a new catheter was inserted, this step is not required. 
 
b. Close the roller clamp to the normal saline and open the roller clamp to the blood. 
 
c. Adjust the flow rate with the main roller clamp. 
 
(1) Set the flow rate to deliver approximately 10 to 25 cc of blood over the first 15 
minutes. 
NOTE: When delivering blood by piggyback, begin the infusion by opening the roller clamp on 
the normal saline line and setting it to keep open (TKO) rate. Adjust the roller clamp on the 
blood line to deliver 10 to 25 cc of blood over the first 15 minutes. 
 
CAUTION: Any time an adverse reaction is suspected, immediately stop the blood and infuse 
normal saline. Notify the charge nurse and medical officer immediately. 
 
(2) Monitor the vital signs closely for the first 15 minutes and observe for indications of 
an adverse reaction to the blood. 
 
(3) Set the main roller clamp to deliver the prescribed flow rate if, after the first 15 
minutes, no adverse reaction is suspected and the vital signs are stable. 
NOTE: Use the correct formula to calculate flow rate. (See Figure 3-18.) 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-539 
 
Figure 3-18. IV Flow rate calculation 
 6. Monitor and evaluate the patient throughout the procedure. 
 
a. Monitor vital signs every hour or more frequently lAW local SOP. 
 
b. Compare the vital signs with previous and baseline vital signs. 
 
c. Observe for changes that indicate an adverse reaction to the blood. 
CAUTION: When a transfusion reaction occurs or is suspected, the unused blood and recipient 
tubing must be sent to the laboratory along with a 10 ml specimen of the patient’s venous blood 
and a post transfusion urine specimen. 
 
d. Stop the blood, infuse normal saline, and notify the charge nurse and medical officer if a 
reaction is suspected. 
 7. Discontinue the infusion of blood. 
 
a. When the blood pack has emptied, close the clamp to the blood and open the clamp to 
the normal saline. 
 
b. Flush the tubing and filter with approximately 50 cc of normal saline to deliver the 
residual blood. 
 
c. After the residual blood has been delivered, run the normal saline at a TKO rate or hang 
another solution, if one has been prescribed. 
 
d. Take and record the vital signs at the completion of the transfusion and 1 hour after 
completion. 
NOTE: As a rule, a unit of blood should be infused within 2 to 4 hours unless contraindicated by 
risk of circulatory overload. If the prescribed flow rate will deliver the blood within a shorter or 
longer period of time, verify the order with the charge nurse or prescribing medical officer. 
 8. Dispose of the used blood pack lAW local SOP. 
 
a. Return it to the laboratory blood bank with a copy of SF 518. 
 
b. Discard it in a container for contaminated waste. 
 9. Document the procedure and significant nursing observations on the appropriate forms lAW 
local SOP. 
 
a. Complete the SF 518. 
 
(1) Return one copy to the laboratory blood bank.

 2. Put on gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE). 
 
a. Eye protection. 
 
b. Gown. 
 
c. Shoe covers, if needed. 
 3. Locate proper site for EZ IO insertion. 
NOTE: The provider identifies the insertion site and landmarks. 
 
a. Anterior tibia. 
NOTE: For tibial insertion, the insertion site is usually located at the anterior-medial distal tibia. 
For pediatric patients, the insertion site is the anterior-medical proximal tibia just below the tibial 
tuberosity. 
 
b. Distal tibia. 
 
c. Proximal humerus (used in adult patients only). 
 4. Assemble IV infusion fluid and tubing using aseptic technique. (See task 081-833-0033.)

NOTE: This will break the 'seal' and allow you to remove the cap once the driver and needle set 
have stopped turning. 
 7. Insert EZ IO needle set. 
 
a. Holding the driver in your dominant hand, stabilize the leg near the insertion site with 
your non-dominant hand. 
NOTE: Control the patient's movement prior to and during needle insertion. 
 
b. Position the driver at the insertion site with the needle at a 90 degree angle to the 
surface of the bone. 
 
c. Gently power or press needle set until needle set tip touches bone. 
WARNING: Do not use excessive force. Allow the needle set rotation and gentle downward 
pressure to provide the penetrating action. 
CAUTION: Make sure the driver is maintained at a 90 degree angle at all times. 
 
d. Penetrate bone cortex by squeezing the driver's trigger and applying gentle, steady, 
downward pressure. 
 
e. Release driver's trigger and stop insertion process when a sudden "give" or "pop" will be 
felt upon entry into the medullary space or when the desired depth is obtained. 
NOTE: If the driver stalls and will not penetrate the bone, you may be applying too much 
downward pressure. In the unlikely event of a driver failure, remove the power driver, grasp the 
needle set by your dominant hand and advance the needle set into the medullary space while 
twisting the needle set. 
 8. Stop when the needle flange touches the skin or a sudden decrease in resistance is felt.

Subject Area 24: Triage and Evacuation 
Coordinate Casualty Treatment and Evacuation 
081-833-0227 
Conditions: You are deployed to a unit in a forward area. There are casualties that must be 
treated and evacuated to receive medical aid. You will need a military vehicle (ground vehicle or 
rotary-wing aircraft), litters, and straps (or materials to improvise them). You are not in a CBRN 
environment. 
Standards: Ensure that medical and/or self-aid/buddy aid is provided to the casualties, as 
appropriate. Ensure that the casualties are transported to medical aid or to a pickup site using 
an appropriate carry or, if other Soldiers are available, by litter. Ensure that the litters are 
properly loaded onto a military vehicle (ground vehicle or rotary-wing aircraft) without dropping 
or causing further injury to the casualties. 
Performance Steps 
 1. Evaluate the casualties according to the tactical situation. (See task 081-833-0281.) 
NOTE: Tactical combat casualty care (TC-3) can be divided into three phases. 
* Care under fire-you are under effective hostile fire and are very limited as to the care 
you can provide. 
* Tactical field care-you and the casualty are relatively safe and no longer under 
effective hostile fire, and you are free to provide casualty care to the best of your ability. 
* Tactical evacuation care-care is rendered during casualty evacuation (CASEVAC). 
 2. Coordinate treatment of the casualties according to the tactical situation and available 
resources. 
 3. Request medical evacuation (MEDEVAC). (See task 081-831-0283.) 
 
a. Make contact. 
 
b. Determine whether casualties must be moved or will be picked up at the current location. 
If they must be moved, continue with step 4. If they will not be moved, continue to monitor 
communications and go to step 6. 
 4. Move a casualty, if necessary, using a four-man litter squad. 
NOTE: If military vehicles and litter materials are not available, continue with step 5. 
NOTE: Four-man litter squad bearers should be designated with a number from 1 to 4. The litter 
bearer designated as #1 is the leader of the squad. 
 
a. Prepare the litter. 
 
(1) Open a standard litter. 
 
(2) Lock the spreader bars at each end of the litter with your foot. 
 
b. Prepare the casualty. 
 
(1) Place the casualty onto the litter. 
 
(2) Secure the casualty to the litter with litter straps. 
 
c. Lift the litter. 
 
(1) Position one squad member at each litter handle with the litter squad leader at the 
casualty's right shoulder. 
NOTE: The leader should be at the right shoulder to monitor the casualty's condition. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3-550 
 
3 May 2013 
 
(2) On the preparatory command, "Prepare to lift," the four bearers kneel beside the litter 
and grasp the handles. 
 
(3) On the command, "Lift," all bearers rise together. 
 
(4) On the command, "Four man carry, move," all bearers walk forward in unison. 
 
 
(a) If the casualty does not have a fractured leg, carry the casualty- 
 
* Feet first on level ground. 
 
* Head first when going uphill. 
 
 
(b) If the casualty has a fractured leg, carry the casualty- 
 
* Head first on level ground. 
 
* Feet first when going uphill. 
 5. Coordinate transportation of casualties using appropriate carries, if necessary. 
 6. Coordinate loading of casualties onto a military vehicle. 
 
a. Ground ambulance. 
NOTE: Ground ambulances have medical personnel to take care of the casualties during 
evacuation. Follow any special instructions for loading, securing, or unloading casualties. 
 
(1) Secure each litter casualty to his litter. 
 
(2) Load the most serious casualty last. 
 
(3) Load the casualty head first (head in the direction of travel) rather than feet first. 
 
(4) Secure each litter to the vehicle. 
 
b. Air ambulance. 
NOTE: Air ambulances have medical personnel to take care of the casualties during evacuation. 
Follow any special instructions for loading, securing, or unloading casualties. 
 
(1) Secure each litter casualty to his litter. 
 
(2) Remain 50 yards from the helicopter until the litter squad is signaled to approach the 
aircraft. 
 
(3) Approach the aircraft in full view of the aircraft crew, maintaining visual confirmation 
that the crew is aware of the approach of the litter party. Ensure that the aircrew can continue to 
visually distinguish friendly from enemy personnel at all times. Maintain a low silhouette when 
approaching the aircraft. 
 
(4) Approach UH-60/UH-1 aircraft from the sides. Do not approach from the front or rear. 
If you must move to the opposite side of the aircraft, approach from the side to the skin of the 
aircraft. Then, hug the skin of the aircraft, and move around the front of the aircraft to the other 
side. 
 
(5) Load the most seriously injured casualty last. 
 
(6) Load the casualty who will occupy the upper birth first, then load the next litter 
casualty immediately under the first casualty. 
NOTE: This is done to keep the casualty from accidentally falling on another casualty if his litter 
is dropped before it is secured. 
 
(7) When casualties are placed lengthwise, position them with their heads toward the 
direction of travel. 
STP 8-68W13-SM-TG 
3 May 2013 
 
3-551 
 
(8) Secure each litter to the aircraft. 
 
(9) After loading the casualty onto the aircraft, the litter squad departs at the same time 
as one unit. 
 
c. Ground military vehicles. 
NOTE: Nonmedical military vehicles may be used to evacuate casualties when no medical 
evacuation vehicles are available. 
NOTE: FM 4-02. 2 (Medical Evacuation) contains suggested loading plans for many common 
nonmedical vehicles. You should become familiar with the plans for vehicles assigned to your 
unit. 
 
(1) When loading casualties into the vehicle, load the most seriously injured casualty 
last. 
 
(2) When a casualty is placed lengthwise, load the casualty with his head pointing 
forward, toward the direction of travel. 
 
(3) Secure each litter casualty to his litter. 
 
(4) Secure each litter to the vehicle as it is loaded into place. 
 
(5) Watch the casualties closely for life-threatening conditions and provide treatment, as 
necessary, during CASEVAC. 
NOTE: CASEVAC refers to the movement of casualties aboard nonmedical vehicles or aircraft. 
Care is rendered while the casualty is awaiting pickup or is being transported. A Soldier 
accompanying an unconscious casualty should monitor the casualty's airway, breathing, and 
bleeding. 
Evaluation Preparation: 
Setup: Evaluate this task during a training exercise involving a MEDEVAC aircraft or vehicle, or 
simulate it by creating a scenario, and provide the equipment needed for the evaluation. 
Brief Soldiers: Tell the Soldier the scenario to include the end result desired.

Subject Area 25: Medication Administration 
Administer Medication Through Endotracheal Tube 
081-833-0309 
Conditions: You have a medical officer's order to give medication via an endotracheal tube 
(ET). You will need an end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) detection device or esophageal detection 
device, handheld resuscitation bag, prescribed medication, syringe or adapter, sterile water or 
normal saline solution, pen, DA Form 4678 Therapeutic Documentation Care Plan, patient's 
clinical record, and SF 510 Nursing Notes. You have verified the medical officer's order, the 
medication (using the six rights) and the patient. You have performed a patient care hand wash 
and taken body substance isolation (BSI) precautions. You are not in a CBRN environment. 
Standards: Administer medication through an endotracheal tube, using aseptic technique and 
without causing harm/injury to the patient. 
Performance Steps 
WARNING: Before injecting any drug, check proper placement of the ET tube, using an endtidal CO2 detector or an esophageal detection device. 
 1. Explain procedure and provide privacy for patient. 
NOTE: In an emergency, some drugs may be given through an ET tube, if intravenous (IV) 
access is not available. They may be given using the syringe method or adapter method. 
 2. Position patient in the supine position. 
NOTE: Make sure their head is level with or slightly higher than their trunk. 
 3. Ventilate the patient. 
NOTE: Three to five times with the resuscitation bag and then remove the bag. 
 4. Administer medication. 
 
a. Syringe method. 
 
(1) Remove the needle before injecting medication into the ET tube. 
 
(2) Insert the tip of the syringe into the ET tube and inject the drug deep into the tube. 
 
b. Adapter method. 
NOTE: An adapter for ET drug administration provides a more closed system of drug delivery 
than the syringe method. 
 
(1) A special adapter placed on the end of the ET tube allows needle insertion and drug 
delivery through the closed stopcock. 
WARNING: Beware that the drug's onset of action may be quicker than it would be by IV 
administration. 
CAUTION: Potential complications of ET drug administration results from the prescribed drug, 
not the administration route. 
 
(2) After injecting the drug, reattach the resuscitation bag and ventilate the patient 
briskly. 
NOTE: This propels the drug into the lungs, oxygenates the patient and clears the tube. 
 5. Discard syringe in an appropriate sharps container. 
 6. Document the procedure on SF 510. 
 
a. Date of administration.
