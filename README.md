The First Responder Virtual Reality Simulator (FRVRS) is a high-fidelity, fully immersive, automated, programmable virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to train frontline responders to treat and triage victims of mass casualty incidents. The VR platform tracks and records (logs) their performance as they navigate the disaster scene. Output from the system provides feedback to participants on their performance, and, in our case, a statistically analyzable dataset of patient engagement events. Doug Danforth has kept these logs of participant trainees for our analysis.

The purpose of the FRVRS Logs Dataset Analysis Report (FLDAR) is to provide TA1 with a dataset of Doug Danforth’s FRVRS logs in addition to anything useful to be found in analyzing the decisions taken by the first responder trainees (DMs) of the FRVRS.
