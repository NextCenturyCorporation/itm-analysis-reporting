# Executive Summary

 

Version 1.0 of the First Responder Virtual Reality Simulator (FRVRS) logger does not provide a moment-by-moment record of the whereabouts of the first responder trainee (DM), nor an indication of which patient is being observed. Therefore, we are unable to accurately model a theory of mind with respect to the DM's decisions. It is recommended in later versions that DM_GAZE, PATIENT_ENGAGEMENT_END and DM_LOCATION be added to the action types that the logger tracks.

 

# Introduction

 

The FRVRS is a high-fidelity, fully immersive, automated, programmable virtual reality (VR) simulation designed to train frontline responders to treat and triage victims of mass casualty incidents. The VR platform tracks and records (logs) their performance as they navigate the disaster scene. Output from the system provides feedback to participants on their performance, and, in our case, a statistically analyzable dataset of patient engagement events. Doug Danforth has kept these logs of participant trainees for our analysis.



The purpose of this FRVRS Logs Dataset Analysis Report (FLDAR) is to provide TA1 with a dataset of Doug Danforth’s FRVRS logs in addition to anything useful to be found in analyzing the decisions taken by the first responder trainees (DMs) of the FRVRS.
